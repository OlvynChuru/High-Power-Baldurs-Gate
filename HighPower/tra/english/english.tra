The time to strike is now.

You are to insinuate yourself into the crowd in the ballroom. When I have finished my speech, you will strike. If you aren't there, my doppelgangers will proceed without you, and your payment will be forfeit. Make sure to keep a leash on your little bitch of a wife. An invitation to the party is included with this note.

Sarevok

(This looks to be an important note, one that you should hold on to.)~
@1101=~An interesting piece o' material you got there. Greater Ankheg, if I'm not mistaken. Been a while since I seen the like, but if I remember correctly, it makes a fine set of armor. If properly treated it's sturdier than full plate and less than a quarter of the weight! If you're willing to part with your shells I'll give you 2,500 gold for the lot of them. No more can I offer with business as slow as it is. Iron shortage hurting us all.~
@1102=~Ah, this will make a fine suit of plate for a governor or better. Nobility like exotic materials and don't care much about the price. Probably close to 100,000 gold for a tenday's work when I'm finished. I may survive this iron shortage after all.~
@1103=~Whoa! Iron is not so scarce as to make me that desperate! 2,500 gold or nothing, and you can take it or leave it!~
@1104=~Hello again! Still have that greater ankheg shell I see. Have you reconsidered my offer for it? 2,500 gold is fair.~
@1105=~It's you again. I am afraid I'm no longer interested in the greater ankheg shell ye possess. I can tell by the sight of it that it's begun to rot. You'll not get 1 gold for it now, let alone 2,500. What a shame.~
@1106=~A shame it is. It could bring quite a bit once finished. How about this? For 20,000 gold I'll make it into plate for you instead. It's half my normal rate for working on an exotic, but, as I mentioned, business is slow.~
@1107=~Back again, are you? Well, which will it be? Sell me the shell for 2,500, or do I make you armor for 20,000?~
@1108=~A fair price for the workmanship of Taerom Thunderhammer. 20,000 gold it is.~
@1109=~20,000 gold is ridiculous! It would be cheaper to make it from the gold itself!~
@1110=~Here's your 20,000. Make me a suit of armor to be proud of.~
@1111=~On second thought, I am desperately in need of the armor now. I happen to get stabbed a lot. How about I give you 25,000 gp to have it done tomorrow?~
@1112=~Journal entry:
An Offer from Taerom
Taerom "Thunderhammer" of Beregost will pay me 2,500 gold for every greater ankheg shell that I find.~

One lousy ankheg shell for 2,500 gold? I can't believe everyone isn't out hunting those giant bug monsters.~
@1114=~Journal entry:
An Offer from Taerom
For 20,000 gold, Taerom "Thunderhammer" can make me a new suit of plate mail from that greater ankheg shell I found. Also, he says there's a 5,000 gold bounty on a madman named Bassilus. Coincidence? I think not.~
@1115=~Just back from an ankheg frenzy across the river and a bit south. They're in one of their boom cycles, I guess. With iron all shot to hell, there's a good market for greater ankheg armor these days. Bring me back a greater ankheg shell and I'll trade you my axe for it.~
@1116=~Fine work. I'll give you my axe for all of your greater ankheg heads.~
@1117=~Journal entry:
Ankheg Culling
In west Baldur's Gate, a sturdy old dwarf by the name of Fenten has promised to give his axe in exchange for the shell of a greater ankheg. Apparently there's one of them to the south of the city, across the river.~
@1118=~Journal entry:
Ankheg Culling
In exchange for our greater ankheg shells, Fenten gave us his axe as promised.~
@1119=~Good work for killing those ankhegs while sticking to the quota. You can have my staff; it's going to stop functioning soon anyway. Go find yourself a room in the city and rest up. You've earned it.~

Ankhegs are tough to kill, but Gerde's staff is a welcome reward.~
@1121=~This is exactly what I need. Irlentree and Zorl are obviously shapeshifters! I want you to track down and kill every one of them.~
@1122=~There are still more rakshasas. We won't be safe until you've killed them all.~
@1123=~Journal entry:
Investigating the Merchants' League Estate
After dealing with the rakshasas, I reported to Aldeth Sashenstar, who gave me a sword baneful to shapeshifters. Perhaps he should have given it to me BEFORE I faced the rakshasas!~
@1124=~Well done, if I do say so myself! A fine bit of burglary with no unnecessary attention brought to yourself. You can have this sword as a reward. In addition, my Halruaan contact Resar would like to speak with you.~
@1125=~A very expensive setback you have cost us! Your incompetence means counterfeit ships in ports by year's end! A more profound dishonor to the brilliant craftsmen of my land I cannot imagine! Protests from our statesmen will be launched, and your local governor will be made to see our point of view. In the between, all record of this furtive attempt will be erased. Apologies, but you must die!~ [RESAR01]
@1126=~The recovery of our secret is most welcome, but the scrutiny your actions bring will do much damage. I must erase all knowledge of this plan by removing all expendable people. This unfortunately means you. Apologies, but you must die!~ [RESAR01]
@1127=~Alatos was most assuring in his description of your abilities. Right he was, and it is unfortunate I must close all loose ends. This includes potential loose tongues, and, though talented, you are also expendable. Apologies, but you must die!~ [RESAR01]
@1128=~This was risky venture from the start, and though you have undoubtedly slowed ship building, they will now be on guard. Further thievery is impossible, so now to expensive diplomacy. All record of this attempt must be destroyed, including all those expendable. Apologies, but you must die!~ [RESAR01]
@1129=~Tazok did not send thee? Then thou art dead. Help, my minions, HEEELLLPPP!~ [MULAH07]
@1130=~I yield, I yield to thee! Accept my surrender?~ [MULAH02]
@1131=~Fools, you'll never have the chance to take anything! Minions, come forth and kill the intruders!~ [MULAH03]
@1132=~Thanks be to you! Here is an enchanted bow that might help you on your journeys.~
@1133=~They did quite a number on me, those half-ogres. Those brutes are nearly impossible to hit. There's a band of them fortifying themselves in the mountains south-southwest of here... If you could give them a taste of justice, that would do me proud.~
@1134=~Fine work! News of the battle has reached me even here. In an effort to encourage such deeds of righteousness, allow me to present to you my magical gloves... The Sword Coast needs more heroes of your sort, especially in times as dark as these.~
@1135=~Journal entry:
Half-ogres Near Beregost
Bjornin is as generous as he is brave. For my efforts against the half-ogres, he gave me his magical gloves.~
@1136=~<CHARNAME>! I have received news that you have cleared out the Firewine Bridge ruins! No longer will kobolds plague our tiny village. I must congratulate you on a job well done. Everyone is grateful for your help. Take this sling as a show of our gratitude.~
@1137=~A job done well in every respect, and no finer a specimen could I have wished for. By far, she is the most elusive spell component I have ever had to seek. Her body will yield a score of human control potions, as well as a cloak of bravery! I am assured wealth for this season and next at the very least, and I have you to thank. You please have this item and enjoy, yes. It is a good thing you do here today. Show yourselves out, I have much work to attend to.~
@1138=~It is unfortunate that I could only tap some of her resources, but at least I managed to get the cloak out of her; now I must look for another. Maybe... no. I have no time to waste with you right now, so could you kindly be on your way?~
@1139=~You will be paid with a powerful magical amulet for this service.~
@1140=~Thank you for returning with the Helm of Balduran. It was so good to do business together. Here is the amulet, and I shall take the helm. Now I must be off, I'll leave you with some of my servants to escort you out. My servants aren't known for their gentle nature, so I would leave as soon as possible.~
@1141=~Yeah, yeah. Lay off the short-guy jokes, they're older than your grandmother's uncle. The damn blade ain't worth nothing. It's a pride thing. If ya wipe 'is arse with it, I'll give ya a magic sword of mine. Its magic is double edged and no one wants to buy it from me.~
@1142=~Bah, the sword ain't worth the tin she's made from. If ya seal that yappin' mouth of 'is for good, I'll give ya a magic sword of mine. Its magic is double edged and no one wants to buy it from me.~
@1143=~Hmph. Figured maybe he'd eaten it by now. I hope you ran 'im through once or twice to get it, at least. Now take your sword and be gone.~
@1144=~There's been something killing peoples in and 'round the farms here. Zombies or something. I can understands if you can't stomach the task but, just between you an' me real personal-likes, I don't know who else is gonna do it... All of us haves been goin' for a week now without sleep. We've counted twenty zombies or so, so keep track as you kill 'em, if that's what you plans on doing. Once you got 'em all, come back here and I'll gives you the 150 gold pieces that some of us have pooled together. One of us is also offering a pair of boots; he says it's magic but I haves no idea.~
@1145=~Thanks, that's been real generous of yous. Maybe we all can finally get a wink o' sleep yet. Here's that 150 gold pieces and the boots we promised yous. If we hads more, we'd gives 'em to you.~
@1146=~There's a jester by the name of Binky staying at the carnival in Nashkel. He wears a magical cloak and I need you to get your larcenous hands on it and bring it back to me. I assure you that your reward will be handsome. Try not to kill him, just filch it off his person.~
@1147=~Ah, thank you so much. Here is 150 gold pieces and a magic bow for your efforts.~
@1148=~Oh, I do like your handiwork. Here is 200 gold pieces and a magic bow for the trouble.~
@1149=~Do you have Binky's cloak with you?~
@1150=~Journal entry:
Binky's Cloak
The dwarf Pheirkas wants me to steal a cloak from a jester named Binky, who I can find at the carnival in Nashkel. Pheirkas awaits the cloak in the northwest section of Baldur's Gate.~
@1151=~Thanks and long live the foolish! Here's 500 gold pieces for taking care of that on such short notice. Also, you might want this. It's a cloak I obtained from a fence I know in Athkatla.~
@1152=~So, you have proved yourself to be of some use after all. As I told you, Gervisse was a dirty old man and this city is safer without him. Here, allow me to give this ring as a... thank you for services rendered.~
@1153=~They're Doom Kobolds, dozens of them. They captured me and stripped me down. The dirty imps tortured me with their insects, but I got away. They'll be here soon. We have to run, get out of here.~
@1154=~Ah, the iron mine in the Cloakwood? So you're the one who wiped it clean? Congratulations and well achieved. My friend Gretek and his party are coming here soon. They'll be so excited to hear your tale.~
@1155=~Wait, I recognize you! You're the hero of Nashkel and the liberator of mines there and here! Stay for a time; my friend Gretek will want to meet you.~
@1156=~<CHARNAME>! We've found you! Battle after battle you have won against the Iron Throne, but this battle you will not. Ready yourself!~
@1157=~Fight if you want, but you are veritably outmatched. I have a friendly band of Merry Fools excited to leap to my defense.~
@1158=~I don't care to indulge a group of jabbering idiots. Take your death threats elsewhere.~
@1159=~There are no Merry Fools to leap to your side any longer, because I killed the last of them a day ago. We have waited for you to settle in this tavern, and you have fallen right into our trap. Sorry to say, but you are the one who is outmatched!~
@1160=~My thanks for your carelessness to your own survival! If you have no wish to fight then that makes what comes next all the easier!~
@1161=~You there! State your business, but don't move from where you stand! I don't want to have to sic the umber hulks on you!~
@1162=~You found my gauntlets! I was beginning to think they'd never show up. Here, take this quiver as your reward. I'm sure you'll have a use for it some time.~
@1165=~Time to go home, Rufie. You'll like the Bleak Eternity much better than these cold climes.~
@1166=~Demons in the Mines

Unfortunately, the rumors were true. There are demons in these mines. I should go further into these mines and find the source of the demons.~
@1167=~Heh, ye're a wonder, you are. Stick with me and we'll go far... Well, okay, stick with me and we'd prob'ly never leave the walls of Candlekeep, would we...? They say the bandits out there aren't after gold and gems anymore but just plain old iron. It's one of them whatchamacallits, paradoxes or whatever: It's dangerous, so you want to wear some good solid plate and carry an axe that'd make Tempus jealous, but rather than protectin' ya, it just makes everyone want a piece of you, right? And supposedly them bandits can shoot an arrow straight through armor. Given my druthers, I guess I'd rather stay right here...~
@1168=~Heh, ye're a wonder, you are. Stick with me and we'll go far... Well, okay, stick with me and we'd prob'ly never leave the walls of Candlekeep, would we...? Hmm, good thing you ain't wearin' none of that metal armor though, as I hear that the bandits out there would just as soon kill you as look at you to get it off your back. And them bandits are said to be so accurate they can shoot an arrow straight through metal armor! I just hope this whole iron crisis business is wrapped up soon.~
@1169=~*sob*... Pixie, my cat, she turned a bird into a rat and fell into the water chasing it... *sniff*... I hope she's all right.~
@1170=~Thanks for saving Arabelle here. Ever since them xvarts an' their kobold kin swarmed the mines at Nashkel, they've been makin' attacks like that more and more often. If someone like yourself could get to the bottom of that, all of us trying to make an honest livin' out here sure would be grateful. Here, take this magic scroll. I don't know what it does.~
@1171=~The favor I ask of you is a simple one. The holy day Storm Call approaches. It will be the first time I have overseen this ceremony. To ensure that my first ceremony is flawless, I need an item of power. It is called the Tome of Wondrous Fortune, and it is possessed by the clergy of Tymora at the Temple of Tymora, called the Lady's Hall by those who venerate the frivolous goddess. If you can get this book for me, I will do what you ask. What is your decision?~
@1172=~So, you've returned with the Tome of Wondrous Fortune. Let me see it.~
@1173=~We are in desperate need of a book known as the Tome of Wondrous Fortune. Please, we will do anything if you'd only give it to us.~
@1174=~The Tome of Wondrous Fortune is a very holy book. Why should I give it to the likes of you?~
@1175=~Fear not. I was not presuming to tell thee where to go, for thou art more than capable. I will leave thee to thy travels. But take this book, which will inform thee of some of the dangers thou may encounter. Luck be with thee, for thou've made some vengeful enemies: some that thou've yet to meet, and some as close as thine own heart. ~
@1176=~As thou hast no doubt determined, the clues seem to point towards the Cloakwood forest. 'Tis likely that the scoundrels behind the bandits have some sort of base within the wood. Of course, I am only telling thee things that thou dost already know. Good luck on thy travels, young one. Be wary as well, for thou art making powerful enemies, both here... and within thyself. I am sorry I cannot speak more plainly on this matter, but events must unfold as they will without any meddling from this old man. As a final act of guidance, thou may have this book, which will inform thee of some of the dangers that lie ahead.~
@1301=~It is a surprise to find such beautiful people coming into this seedy place. All of you look rather weary, down on your times I might say. Why don't I treat you to some refreshments, perhaps some Berduskan amber wine?~
@1302=~Sorry if I seem out of breath, but I am still recovering from an earlier battle. I was ambushed by a dozen gnolls a little while ago. I handily dispatched them but thought better of fighting their half dozen ogre friends. I think I'm safe from them here. Would any of you care for a drink of some fine Selgauntian brandy?~
@1303=~Every so often, I will ask you if you've had enough. If you have, then I shall teleport you back outside. If you wish to continue practicing, however, then I shall create some more illusions for you to fight. Are you ready then? Good, here we go! I will start by summoning some gibberlings. Gibberlings can move terribly fast, and they attack in a whirlwind of slashes. They are very dangerous normally, but my illusions will not harm you.~
@1304=~Good! Then I will create some more illusory monsters. This time I'll create some xvarts. Xvarts stop time whenever they move. I have managed to replicate this ability with my illusions.~
@1305=~Good! Then I'll create some more illusory monsters. This time I'm going to create some skeletons. Strike a skeleton and its body will fall apart, but its skull will animate and continue to fight on. Osprey's Magical Stone spell will prevent this effect from happening.~
@1306=~Good! Then I'll create some more illusory monsters. I'm creating kobolds this time. There are many, many different kinds of kobolds, each with their own strange powers. My illusions only replicate one kind.~
@1307=~Good! Then I'll create even more illusory monsters. This time I'll create some tasloi. Looking a tasloi in the eye causes you to go uncontrollably berserk. My illusions have this power as well, though their gaze is easier to resist than that of wild tasloi. Mordaine's robe will protect her from the tasloi's gaze.~
@1308=~Some of your comrades will have magic items. It would be wise to understand what these items do, as even the more generic magic items can have unique powers.~
@1401=~The mask intones: "Ooze splits before fire and lightning, but is destroyed by mundane blows."~
@1402=~The mask intones: "Fire, ice, slime, and wind. All must perish to continue."~
@1403=~How shallow do you think me that I would give up my destiny after a few short words with you? Have you no strength to YOUR convictions? I have no pity for your kind! You will be swept aside! You are already too late, and a new age rises! Behold Aec'Letec, the deadliest of all nabassus! Born of the Abyss, but destined to walk the Prime! The dagger is broken! Behold your new lord and master!~
@1404=~By all that is loud and windy, will you please shut up?! You can pose all you wish, but you have failed! Here will come the new lord, despite your slogans! Here will come the new lord, despite your puny weapons! Here will come the new lord, Aec'Letec, deadliest of all nabassus! Born of the Abyss, let he who was imprisoned walk the Prime! The dagger is broken! I release you!~
@1405=~~
@1601=~I've heard that Amn is going to invade. Those damnable, war-mongering mutton-heads. They're like quicklings, the way those soldiers run about, and no better either. Shoulda seen it coming too. This iron thing has to be all their doing. You ain't from the south, are ya? If you are, then I don't trust ya!~
@1602=~You look a lot like the bandits that raided my caravan! No, maybe it wasn't you. You don't look like you could fire arrows the way they can. This crisis just has me on edge. I see bandits wherever I look. Hope it all ends soon, one way or another.~
@1603=~Nashkel is a rotten town, run by a bunch of priggers and the quicks that call themselves soldiers. Betcha this iron shortage is just another Amnian plot. They would love to get a hold of Baldur's Gate, I just know it.~
@1604=~Hey! Shut your potato trap and give your tongue a holiday. I don't want strangers in my business. Shove off before I start to shoot fire out of my hands.~
@1605=~I bet those rank-ridin' bandits are hired by the Amnian. It'd be like those moneygrubbers to pull something so low. Their own soldier-quicks can barely aim a bow so they hire brigand scum to do it for them...~
@1606=~My son was on one of the caravans that didn't make it to Baldur's Gate. I pray to Tymora that he's all right. May the Lady guide him safely home, and may she rob these bandits of their unholy accuracy. They deserve much worse.~
@1607=~You're pathetic... Okay, I'll rattle it off for you like I did for the last adventurer and the one before that. I have no doubt you'll share their fate. Let's see, there are the ruins of an old mage school to the southeast. Traps, dead things that try to kill you, and creatures of magic itself, supposedly... Then there's the Firewine Bridge: ghosts, minotaurs, winding narrow passageways, some poetry, blah, blah, blah... Honestly, I can't think of a life more tedious than that of an adventurer. Personally, I get far more out of wandering around aimlessly and scratching my arse like this.~
@1608=~Did you hear another Flaming Fist just got killed defending us from bandits? A brigand bowman shot an arrow straight through her plate armor. If the city watch cannot protect us from raids, what am I paying tax for?! I would be better off hiring mercenaries than trying to rely on the city guards. Nobody is fool enough to want to guard my caravans though. Cowards all. Guess I'll just wait out the crisis here.~
@1609=~I was attacked outside the city last week. Was by a gnome with muscles to wrestle a giant, carrying a sword twice his size! Yet he could barely walk without tripping, and I fled faster than he could follow. Every night I fear he could be coming for me.~
@1610=~It will be a cold day in the lower planes before I risk my neck in the elven ruin o' Firewine! I hear a lord of minotaurs makes his home there, and I have no wish to meet such a monster in those tight passages. You can barely stand two abreast in there. Tight enough to be a tomb, and for many a man it is a tomb.~
@1611=~That Ulcaster School was a storehouse of knowledge and magic, but the shadowy spirits that haunt the place are no better for it. Being dead longer than you were alive must tend to addle the mind.~
@1612=~The most dangerous thing I intentionally went after? Stalked a cave bear for a few days once. Had a party of me own back then. Wounded the bear, but then it retaliated like a dragon, consuming my party in waves of fire. Still managed to kill the bear, but not really worth the price of my friends. I've seen more dangerous beasties, but usually over my shoulder as I'm making tracks as fast as I can. No shame in running when your life is on the line. Off with you now, I've meat to catch.~
@1613=~ 'Round here? I wouldn't worry yourself too much, unless you're brainless and charge everything you see. Mostly gibberlings, but they aren't too much of a hassle. Just be sure put an arrow in them before they reach you. Wolves have become a bit more predatory lately. I think it's because more people are hunting for their food, seein' as how the iron shortage took away their normal livelihoods. A hungry wolf is a nasty thing, and I wouldn't travel without a group if I were you. With a group you might stand a better chance of noticing the wolves through their camouflage.~
@1614=~You would do well to know your own limitations. I don't care whether you're a great swords<MANWOMAN> or a powerful wizard. Regardless you will end up filleted in the noonday sun if you do not take proper care. Remember, we are not the only beings with mysterious powers; the beasties of the wild have dangerous abilities as well. Move along, will you? You may be intent on digging an early grave, but I've no wish to share it with you.~
@1615=~Kobolds! Demons, too. They're overrunning the place piece by piece. Both kobolds and demons have been killing us miners. The kobolds and demons don't seem to like each other: I saw a demon kill a kobold. The demons and kobolds both seem to be coming from the lower levels.~
@1616=~Journal entry:
Demons and kobolds have been killing the miners.~
@1617=~We don't have the manpower to patrol the mines, what with the problem of bandits up north. Our shoddy armor hardly matters when a bandit could put an arrow through the best plate mail. We can only hope they don't aim at us...~
@1618=~Travel lightly, wanderer. The woods harbor strange things. I've heard many stories... worm-like creatures harnessing divine magic that can reflect our arrows back at us, monsters that can stop time, and even such a thing as a Greater Ogre. I hope none of these things come to Nashkel, for if they do I will hardly be a match for them.~
@1619=~Move along, citizen. You could be a doppelganger, the way you're coming so close to me. Watch out for doppelgangers in Nashkel right now. We had an encounter with one of them a few days ago, and I suspect there is at least one more of them hiding somewhere in this town.~
@1620=~You heard the rumors flying about town? Supposedly there's a cave to the northeast where there is a giant troll. The adventurer who saw the troll fled as fast as her legs could take her. I hope that troll stays in the cave...~
@1621=~I've lost ten head of cattle in the last month alone! Gall-derned raiders must be gettin' into rustling I figure. My cows crushed some of 'em, but not all.~
@1622=~I swear I saw something moving out back o' my place, so I keep my jumpin' cattle on the watch at night. They be poor guards but I cannot afford any other protection.~
@1623=~How dare you come into my home uninvited! Back in my adventuring days, such an affront would get you a Blade of Disaster in the backside! If 'twere not for social convention I'd give you a right proper disintegration!~
@1624=~Good then. Enjoy your stay. Just a warning, though: we've had shapeshifter trouble recently. It was only a few days ago that a doppelganger murdered a woman at this inn. The stupid fiend did the deed in plain sight. We slew it, but I worry there may be others lurking in disguise. Take my advice: if you encounter a shapeshifter in this inn, flee and ask one of us for help. The guards of the Friendly Arm are professional fighters.~
@1625=~Be careful in your travels, friend; the roads have become exceedingly dangerous. I hate to say it, but this inn is hardly much safer. We've had several encounters with doppelgangers in the inn through the past week. We had no trouble slaying them, but I worry that one might take me by surprise. Now I've become suspicious of every traveller who passes this gate. I wouldn't mistrust you, though.~
@1901=~Will you use the scroll?~
@1902=~Use it.~
@1903=~Put the scroll away.~
@1904=~The walls of Candlekeep are warded to prevent teleportation. You cannot use the scroll right now.~
@1905=~The scroll glows and dissolves as you read it. Moments later, your party is teleported to an unknown location...~
@1906=~The magic of this island prevents teleportation away from it by most means. You cannot use the scroll right now.~

@2751=~Carrion crawler
The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion. However, when such food becomes scarce or when it is threatened, it will attack and kill living creatures.

The carrion crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard.

The monster's head is covered with a tough hide, but the body is not well protected. The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.~
@2752=~Ettercap
Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps-very deadly traps-much like the spiders that often live around them.

Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. Ettercaps' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.

Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks, and violent actions.~
@2753=~Ghoul
Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.

Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.~
@2754=~Gibberling
They come screaming, jabbering, and howling out of the night. Dozens, maybe hundreds, of hunchbacked, naked humanoids swarm unceasingly forward. They have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others with no hope of stopping their mass assault. Then, having come and killed, the gibberlings move on, seemingly randomly, back into the night.

The first impression of gibberlings is of a writhing mass of fur and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed canine ears and black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning faces. Their black eyes shine with a maniacal gleam.~
@2755=~Gnoll
Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands.

While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human. They have greenish-gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish-gray to dull yellow mane.~
@2756=~Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive. 

The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing at least six feet tall. Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.

Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes.~
@2757=~Kobold
Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demihuman races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.

Barely clearing three feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a pair of bright red sparks, and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobold fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.~
@2758=~Ogre
Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls.

Adult ogres stand nine to ten feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color-or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well.

It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.~
@2759=~Skeleton
All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.

Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which would allow movement. Instead, the bones are magically joined together during the casting of an Animate Dead spell. Skeletons have no eyes or internal organs.

Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demihumans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like bugbears and giants.~
@2760=~Giant Spider
Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most are poisonous and bite prey before devouring them because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.

Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.

Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders. Though one kind of giant spider, the sword spider, is a much larger and much faster version of the hunting spider.~

@2822=~Enhanced Alchemy: Concoctions~
@2823=~Given the right ingredients, an Alchemist can concoct any manner of potions and brews. The Alchemist can buy pure ingredients, or simply recycle them from previous concoctions. The process is similar to purchasing goods at a store, but the Alchemist can manage ingredients much more efficiently, making his or her concoctions much less expensive than a conventional apothecary's.

More experienced Alchemists can brew a broader variety of potions and manufacture stronger explosives. There is no limit on how many potions and grenades an Alchemist can create, provided he or she has the resources to make them.

With this ability, the Alchemist can brew more powerful potions than normal.~

@2910=~Bottle of Endless Healing Wine~
@2911=~This wine was obtained after placing the eerily glowing grapes in the winepress and starting the engine. When you breathe deeply, memories of lost loves come rushing back and you find your eyes filling with tears.

The wine is enchanted and can also serve as a healing potion. Drinking from the bottle restores HP but causes the drinker to become intoxicated. The bottle then refills itself through some magical means.

STATISTICS:

Restores 10 HP but gives the drinker 40 points of intoxication. High intoxication scores boost morale but give luck penalties. Intoxication can range between 0 and 100 points, and it wears off over time. A character needs at least 50 points to start receiving penalties. This ability can be used unlimited times per day.

@2915=~This stone seems to be out of place down here, almost as if it wasn't a coincidence at all. Perhaps it has some meaning, maybe even a purpose here. You get an uneasy feeling that this gemstone shouldn't be sold; perhaps it would be best not to be too greedy and keep it around awhile. Normally a deep, pleasant seawater green, beljurils periodically blaze with a glittering, winking, flashing light. However, this particular stone has a slightly different hue; perhaps it is a new strain, rarely if ever seen before. It looks incredibly valuable.

This stone is magical. Once per day, it can be used to charm a greedy humanoid or giant humanoid, making them a loyal ally of the one who holds the stone.

    A single humanoid or giant humanoid must Save vs. Wands or become charmed. The effect lasts for 10 turns if successful.

@2916=~Greagan's Harp: The Captive Audience
This finely made harp is well known among the nomadic peoples of the east, though more for the infamy of its owner, Greagan of Lowhill. He was a bard of sorts, though less for his love of people than his hatred of hard work. He bade a mage relation construct this harp so its magic might disguise his utter lack of talent in the arts. Its power was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary using "his" music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions, though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the most dire of circumstances. The magic seems to be waning as well, and perhaps this is one item best lost to time.

@2920=~Created by a djinni as a "gift" to the drow sorcerer Baeloth Barrityl, this obsidian ring with blood-red ruby almost hypnotically draws the eye to it. The ring allows the wearer to cast spells at a very swift rate, producing a ferocious onslaught of magic. However, the ring also comes with a major drawback.

The djinni that created the ring, not entirely trusting the person to whom it was gifted, wove a curse into the black stone band. Rapid as the wearer's spells may be, they will never target the creature the wearer wanted them to. In addition, once donned, the ring cannot be removed from its wearer's finger, no matter how much <PRO_HESHE> might wish it so.

Long after his comrades had fallen, for days he tore into their seemingly endless numbers before he was eventually overcome as well.

@2973=~Sartessa's Vengeance +1~
@2974=~This was the personal shield of Sartessa, a half-elven Ranger of the Wood of Sharp Teeth. Called to a quest by divine intervention at a young age, she traveled the long way to Luskan seeking to restore peace to the Sword Coast in troubled times. Betrayed near the end of her journey by her long time companion and forced to slay him in self-defense, she forged this shield, imbued with her grim determination to complete her quest despite knowing that alone, such attempt would likely end in death. Powerful enchantments were placed on this shield to stop it from falling into the wrong hands, and although they have faded somewhat with time, it would be foolhardy of anyone to try to wield it that does not resemble her both in spirit and body.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Armor Class: +2, an extra +1 vs. missile attacks
- Immunity to backstab
- Immunity to permanent death
- Immunity to time stop

Weight: 5~
@2976=~Some say a positive mindset is key to victory. The creator of this shield, a dark elven sorcerer in life and feared lich in undeath, clearly had a different idea. Considering the comparative weakness of those concerned with the arcane arts and lack of suitable armour unacceptable, he set out to create the perfect piece of equipment if worst came to worst-a likely scenario for a wizard stuck in close range combat. Ever since, the powerful enchantments on this shield have frequently saved the lives of countless of owners in a pinch or allowed them to escape by the skin of their teeth, equally frequently at the cost of sacrificing their traveling companions.

STATISTICS:

@2978=~This shield can be traced to a line of Paladins of Velen, who carried shields like this one into battle on mounted expeditions to the Nelanther Isles under the blessing of Torm. Celebrated in lore for their memorable armour as the Red Riders, their ceaseless dedication and resilience was a vital force in establishing peace to the region. Although long since dispersed, their legacy is highly sought after as traces of their original blessing still infuse these sets of armour, granting the wearer great protection against the enemies of paladins.

@2979=~This finely crafted and intricately engraved quarterstaff was "improved" upon by Neera herself. Her intent was to create a staff that would inflict fiery pain upon its victims, but she fell slightly short of that goal. While it can light enemies aflame, there is also the chance that the staff will backfire and incinerate its wielder.

STATISTICS:

@2980=~Medusa's Edge +2~
@2981=~This sword is both heavily enchanted and strongly cursed, and it is a great danger to the creatures at both ends of it. However, it did not always have the powers it did today. The earliest known story concerning this weapon is that of a mysterious hooded woman who brought the sword to various temples and paid the high priests large amounts of gold to enchant it. The gods that blessed this sword are a diverse bunch, including good, neutral and evil deities. When these gods found out that their enemies and rivals had also blessed the sword, they all cursed it, causing its enchantments to occasionally backfire on the wielder.

This sword has many powers, and each hit will activate one and only one of them. With each hit, there is a 25% chance that the activated power will strike the wielder instead of the target of the attack. The sword has been known as the Medusa's Edge because the most prominent powers of the sword are petrification and poison.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Once equipped, this sword cannot be removed without a Remove Curse spell

Combat abilities:
- Each hit will cause one of the following effects:
15% chance that the target must Save vs. Petrification at +2 or become petrified

This robe does not have nearly the power that the Hand and Eye of Vecna have; however, its enchantments are still very formidable. Like the Hand or the Eye, wearing this robe is an extremely corrupting experience; the magic of the robe will poison the wearer's mind and turn them evil very quickly.

@2987=~Two-handed Sword +10~
@2988=~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

@3032=~Amulet of Metaspell Influence: The Amplifier
Known for its ability to enhance spellcasting, the Amulet of Metaspell Influence is highly sought after by magic practitioners. It was created by Elairdrin Mellwith, who resided in the Star Mountains. His reasons for fabricating such an item stemmed from his womanizing habits, and to this extent, the Amplifier served his purpose well. It was later taken from him by a mage with a more destructive intent, but records detailing the change of hands vary widely.

Once the arrow penetrates all the way through a creature, it flies out, potentially hitting another creature. Since the arrow continues to apply force even after it hits the target, it deals piercing damage rather than missile damage, and spells that normally block or reflect missile attacks such as Physical Mirror and Entropy Shield do not stop this arrow.

His battle cry was favored by the gods, and was echoed across the lands as a symbol of devoted friendship and loyalty. Thus, the magical axe was used to uphold these virtues against those who lacked honor and courage.

@3414=~Bala's Axe, Wizard Slayer
Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race, he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that allowed him to breach the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards.

Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241 DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest, he couldn't help gloat in his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment, Edwall's head did much the same.

With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

Amaunator is said to have been the god most fervently opposed to the creation of undead, even more so than current deities like Lathander and Kelemvor. Any priest of Amaunator who dared use the god's power to summon undead minions was deemed the worst of heretics. In such a situation it was the duty of the priest's guards to use these bows to slay the priest along with any undead abominations that they created. However, such situations were rare, and the bows were mainly used to destroy the undead created by other, more evil faiths.

First wielded by the much-maligned Ensign Chesley of the first exploratory fleet of Waterdeep, this famous halberd has been passed around for generations, but only to those strong enough to carry its considerable weight.

Most of this weight comes from the strange blue-gray metal that composes the haft. Not much is known about the metal, but it seems to be far more cumbersome than iron, lead, gold or any other heavy metal you have come across. Since its haft is far heavier than its blade, the halberd can potentially be swung in ways that utilize its weight more than its sharpness.

He gave it to a small clan of homeless dwarves that they might carve a place for themselves amongst the giants and ogres in their area. The hammer has been passed from hero to hero, occasionally finding its way into non-dwarven hands.

@6224=~This basic armor is made of thick wax or water-hardened leather. It is sturdy protection, not supple like boots or a cloak. Soft garment leathers like that would offer no more protection than common clothing. Magical enchantments have improved the protective abilities of this particular suit.

@6249=~Rilsa's Leathers +2~
@6250=~This leather armor was worn by the ranger Rilsa. She made good use of its Aura Cleansing ability, which allowed her to hurl many of her innate fireballs in a short time. However, in the end she was killed by goblins, who used their breath weapons on her when she tried to negotiate with them. Although this armor is solid protection against most physical attacks when worn by a ranger, it is no match for breath weapons.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:

- When worn by a Ranger, the armor provides an Armor Class of 2 and the penalties against piercing and missile attacks disappear

@6526=~Rufie's chew toy consists of moist and ragged scraps of flesh hanging from a mangled bone of indiscernible origin. The bone itself is gigantic and terribly heavy. Only the largest, most monstrous dog would chew on a bone like this. As terrifying as such a dog might be, the being that this bone originally came from must have been scarier still.

During this time, he was rumored to dwell in a castle somewhere within the Earthfast Mountains. How his armor moved to other lands without him is not certain, though the separation of the two was surely unpleasant.

@6615=~The Practical Defense +4~
@6616=~The traveling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land. Specially commissioned by Bolhur "Thunderaxe" at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate. Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight, though this suit is just over one-third the weight of normal plate mail: His ideal suit should also be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur "Thunderaxe" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of full plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more for utility than looks.

@6879=~Elixir of Renewed Spirit~
@6880=~This is one of the most powerful potions a wizard can create. Upon drinking it, one is instantly revitalized, as one would from a full night's sleep. Such an effect would allow a wizard or another spellcaster to cast all of their spells again. While it may seem that, if one was a powerful enough wizard, one could create one of these potions with pure magic, drink it to regain the spells, and repeat the process ad infinitum, there is no known way to create one of these potions without consuming large amounts of rare components. In trying to create many of these potions, one quickly runs out of components. In addition, each of these potions takes over a week to craft, even by a master wizard. Since they are so difficult to make, mages who own them are not quick to use them. As a result, there are still a few of these potions lying around throughout the Realms, waiting to be used.

Pellan and his armor digested readily, but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps.

@7462=~This large shield of dwarven darksteel provides more protection than most suits of armor. It was forged and enchanted with one goal, and one goal only: to keep the wielder protected in combat. What might seem a redundant point to make becomes clear when one looks at the sacrifices that have been made towards this aim. Far heavier than most shields of its size and imbued with an antimagical aura, it is very cumbersome to use in battle, and casting with it in hand is virtually impossible.

@8212=~Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated that she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

@8218=~Amidst the plains of the Eastern Shaar there lived a small human blacksmith, whose nearly dwarven height did not do his soul justice. Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn. Only a reclusive Mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement. Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the light-hearted man to leave his home forever. Before he left he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making. Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed. It was not long after that the Mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

Whereas the saber was intended chiefly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, more highly curved, and tapered to an elongated, sharp point. This makes the weapon slightly slower but more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder.

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough. It burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself-but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for <PRO_HIMHER>... or any other humanoid.

They were part of his personal collection, ninjato that he either "collected" from rivals or designed himself. When he died, his mistress gave away the swords to her other lovers, all of them powerful Thieves in their own right.

@8310=~To enchant a katana is no simple process. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword. To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana. The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle. Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

Champion after champion has wielded this blade against countless enemies, and the blood it has spilled could fill a small sea. History will not admit that such a blade could be forged and each consecutive owner seems to tie its origin to whatever creation myth they believe. The most grandiose of these tales is that of a great chieftain who sailed to the cliffs that supposedly bordered the world. There he reached into the void, and his will shaped the blade from nothing. Whatever the truth, in the right hands this sword is a fearsome thing.

This was the heart of Aec'Letec, a nabassu that you slew. Aec'Letec was far more powerful than the average nabassu, capable of changing his enemies into monstrous greater ghast lords rather than regular ghasts.

The iron crisis has taken its toll on the ring; only the enchantment placed on it keeps it from crumbling to nothing.

They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, "losing" it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

When this bone strikes a demon or a devil, rows of razor-sharp teeth sprout all over the bone, tearing into the creature's flesh with great fury. However, this effect only works against demons and devils, not all fiends. Therefore, other kinds of fiends such as hell hounds and yugoloths can handle the bone safely.

Shapeshifted as a human, he handed in a great tome and gained access to the keep. Once inside, he started wreaking havoc. With the help of his mace and his seemingly endless supply of charm and domination spells, he enslaved the captain of the guard as well as many of the Watchers. He and his minions then stormed the inner keep, killing or dominating everyone in his path. However, it did not take much longer for Krotan to meet his match. Although Krotan was just as powerful as the greatest wizards of Candlekeep, there were several such wizards, and there was only one Krotan facing against them. The ogre mage and his army soon got overwhelmed by a team of over ten archmages. After these wizards rendered Krotan helpless with their magic, they transported him to the hidden library beneath Candlekeep, where they cast an Imprisonment spell upon him. Before Krotan was imprisoned, he was stripped of his mace and all but one of his other magic items. The item they left with him was an evil artifact that they preferred be imprisoned with him.

@11741=~Improved Shocking Gauntlets~
@11742=~A long time ago, an industrious little gnome was able to create a special alloy that was capable of retaining a sizable electric charge. He cleverly wove metal strands of this alloy into his leather work gloves and greeted guests with hilariously shocking results. That is until he shook the hands of a passing dwarven weaponsmith. Rumors say the shock was so intense that the poor fellow's beard caught fire. In exchange for his life, the gnomish inventor relinquished the secret to his special alloy to the dwarven weaponsmith. The dwarf started crafting electric weapons using the alloy.

However, the gnome's story was not over, for he continued to craft tools of his own with the alloy, and he was far superior to the dwarf at using it. His greatest invention was the Improved Shocking Gauntlet, a far more powerful version of his old electric work glove. The only Improved Shocking Gauntlets known to exist are the two pairs created by the gnome before he died. He sold one pair to a rich gnome for an extremely hefty sum of money, and he kept the other pair for self-defense. His remaining pair was eventually stolen by a mysterious thief.

The mage Ilginar Hestrow created this cloak to harness their power and gain their help in his travels. However, Hestrow was not a benevolent ranger, but rather a bandit who let his bears loose on merchant caravans. The bears killed the merchants and their guards, incinerating everything except the gold which Hestrow would collect. When traveling through regions where he was not yet notorious, he would dress in simple clothes, masquarading as a ranger. Hestrow met his end when he tried to raid an xvart village near Nashkel. He had never encountered xvarts before and was unaware of their ability to stop time. The xvarts slashed him to shreds while he was frozen in time. They tried to do the same to the cave bears, but one of the bears managed to kill many xvarts with a huge wave of fire before it was put down. After the battle, the xvarts noticed that the fiery blast had burnt the man's body but left his cloak untouched. The xvarts kept the cloak and eventually discovered its magical properties.

The weakness to fire it bestowed upon him was an unexpected side effect of creating the item. Cuchol never bothered to try creating a new Casting Tool without that disadvantage, because he had plenty of ways of protecting himself against fire.

The dagger used to be much more powerful than it is now. There was a time when it tripled the damage of Cuchol's fire spells. However, after a decade of exposure to the magic-draining frozen island, it retains only a fraction of the power it once had.

One of the few scholars renowned enough to be buried in a tomb beneath Candlekeep, Merendi left countless magical trinkets in her resting place, including this fork. However, all these enchanted items were to be food for her guardian. Shortly before her death, Merendi had summoned a Hakeashar to stand guard over her tomb. A creature composed of magic itself, the Hakeashar must periodically consume a small supply of magic or enchantments to remain sane. For hundreds of years, this Hakeashar consumed the magic of the items in Merendi's tomb. Eventually, though, the tomb's hoard ran out of enchantments. The starving Hakeashar became feral, degenerating into a Spellhaunt and scavenging the catacombs for any enchantment it could find.

Merendi's fork used to have the power to make any food it touched extremely tasty. Now, devoid of its enchantments, it is  no more than an ordinary fork. However, the prongs seem to be very sharp, so perhaps it could be used as a stabbing weapon, albeit a weak one. It could be used against creatures that can only be hit by silver weapons, or ones that can only be hit by nonmagical weapons.

@13398=~A legendary, evil artifact of terrifying power, this hand once belonged to Vecna, the greatest of all liches. Ever since his left hand and eye were chopped off by his traitorous servant Kas, they have circulated throughout the multiverse, corrupting many wizards and empowering countless villains.

To equip the Hand of Vecna, one must chop off one's own left hand and place the new Hand in the socket. The Hand will fuse with the creature's arm, but only if the creature is a mage, sorcerer or bard. Once attached, the Hand will corrupt its owner, turning them evil almost instantly. However, it will give its owner power unmatched by almost any other item in the Realms.

STATISTICS:

Special:
- Any non-evil creature who equips the Hand of Vecna becomes evil permanently

Equipped abilities:
- Once attached to a creature, the Hand cannot be removed until after the creature dies; Remove Curse will have no effect on the creature. If the creature is brought back to life, it will be missing its left hand and thus will have a -50 penalty to attacks with a left hand weapon until it attaches the Hand again.

@13595=~Hide Armor +3~
@13596=~Hide armor is made from the thick hide of a very large animal (an elephant for example) or from many layers of normal leather from common animals, like cows. Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. However, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection than leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though Thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities. This armor is enchanted, granting the wearer additional protection.

@13801=~Araglak's Essence~
@13802=~You retrieved the contents of this bottle from the body of Araglak, an elemental that you slew. Araglak was one of the most powerful fire elementals. He was also an impressive shapeshifter, and he took to impersonating Imix, the evil Elemental Prince of Fire. He would present himself to herds of ignorant Primes and demonstrate his amazing powers of fire. He would count on them not knowing that the real Imix was even more powerful than him.

Araglak's essence possesses great magical properties which can be granted to a creature that consumes it, but it is also what fueled the flame of one of the hottest fire elementals. To drink it without any sort of protection against its effects would be practically suicidal.

STATISTICS:

When consumed, Araglack's Essence deals 200 magic fire damage to the character. There is no Saving Throw, Magic Resistance cannot prevent it, and Mirror Image cannot block it. Regular fire resistance cannot reduce the damage, but resistance to magic fire can. If the character survives the damage, he or she permanently gains 50% innate Fire Resistance and 50% innate Magic Fire Resistance.

This power will be granted to a creature who eats the entire eye. It would take a while for a human-sized creature to eat the eye, and the eye also tastes horrible.

The Giant's Tonics make a superhumanly strong creature even stronger, but they have no effect on a creature of average human strength. As a result, Shallangre most often sells these potions to other giants. It is extremely rare for one of these potions to appear elsewhere.

For a creature of about human size or smaller, the full potion has enough liquid for six uses. It has no effect if consumed by a creature with less than 19 Strengh.

@14740=~This ring is composed of three small circular tubes, each of which contains a strange purple fluid. When worn, the ring makes the wearer as strong as anyone could possibly be in this world, yet it severely weakens them in other important ways. It also causes the wearer's body to appear malformed, with large hands and feet, but very thin arms and legs. Most likely this ring was created by a Wish from a fool who wanted to become supernaturally strong.

@14742=~Rings of this kind are used by the baatezu for torture. The ring is put on the finger of the creature to be tortured. When worn, the ring severely weakens the wearer's flesh, to the point where it could easily be shredded with a butter knife (and the baatezu don't use butter knives). As a result, injuries are made much more painful. The ring also causes the wearer to regenerate very quickly. This allows the victim to recover from the painful injuries it just received and be ready to receive more.

@15201=~Orvenir Tunic~
@15202=~Tunics of these kind were worn by members of the Orvenir family of Amn. The Orvenirs were warriors who specialized in fighting without armor. Instead, they went into battle wearing these tunics. The tunics were specially enchanted to make the Orvenirs more powerful in combat, without the restrictions of armor. However, fighters rarely fare well without armor, and the Orvenirs did not last long before getting killed. So many Orvenirs have died in combat that the family has been almost completely wiped out, reduced to a single person, a man named Greywolf.

@15722=~One of the earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end. When the civilized races mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel. Having reached this end, weaponsmiths began experimenting with different types of spearheads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types. This spear is particularly long and very heavy, despite being magical.

@15779=~The Good Spear +1~
@15780=~This spear, sometimes called "The Good Spear," is the bane of evildoers, yet it has gained a much more sinister reputation than other, similar weapons. The reason is that its powers do not stop it from being used by evil creatures. The head of the spear is blessed with great, benevolent divine magics that burn any evil hand that touches it. However, the haft of the spear is not blessed in the same way, and an evil creature can hold it safely.

The Good Spear is thousands of years old. Over the millennia, it has been wielded by countless paladins, but it has also been used in conflicts between evil groups, including the Blood War.

@16219=~Carsomyr~
@16220=~Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.

In normal circumstances, the blade of Carsomyr actually is not very sharp. However, when wielded against an evil or chaotic creature, the blade instantly sharpens and becomes capable of immense damage, even cleaving through enchanted armor to reach the flesh of evildoers. The fact that good people take very little damage from Carsomyr means that it can be used to attack allies to rid them of evil magic.

@16320=~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

@16596=~This extremely powerful wand was created by Ulcaster himself, back when he and his school were alive and well. It may very well be an artifact, for it is the only known wand of its kind. Perhaps the wand is too difficult for anyone other than an archmage to create, but one could only know for sure if one knew how to create it. Alas, Ulcaster never wrote down the secret of the wand's construction. Maybe one could pry the secret out of his ghost, but probably not.

@16996=~In the filthy port town of Luskan, executions are a daily occurrence and a welcome relief from the monotony of town life.  This vorpal greataxe was the only possession of the town executioner, who put its vorpal ability to good use. He was reported to never let the blade leave his side, giving it the name of the "Executioner's Wife."  As the years passed, however, the town executioner eventually found a willing mistress in one of the town's brothels who seemed untroubled by his profession, and he paid her numerous visits over the following months.  When the town authorities came to arrest the harlot (who was actually an accomplished thief) for thefts within the city walls, they found the city executioner in her bed and the woman nowhere to be found.  The executioner was implicated in her escape, and his own axe was used to behead him in the town square.  The execution had a record turnout, and many agreed that the "executioner's wife" had had her final say on his adultery.

@17196=~A more useful version of the Helm of Seeing, this helmet was the legacy of Lanasa Reesan, a powerful fighter-cleric who believed she could get particularly far into Durlag's Tower by herself. With the help of this helmet and her magic, she could easily spot any of the hidden traps and invisible ghasts that have killed many challengers of the tower. As a result, it was a danger she could see that killed her. In one hallway, she detected a crushing wall trap covering the entire passageway. There was no way to get through the hallway without triggering the trap, and there was no other path forward. Since Lanasa could not disarm traps, she could only protect herself with magic and step forward, hoping she would survive. She did not.

The Demon Knight later scavenged the helm from her corpse. In the past, the helm had been a light grey, but it has darkened after several years of being worn by the Demon Knight. It has not gained any unholy properties, though.

@17201=~Elminster's Ecologies I~
@17202=~Elminster's Ecologies-Humanoids and Giant-kin

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about humanoids and giants.

One chapter describes creatures that may be found on the Sword Coast:

"Xvarts-Relatives to kobolds, xvarts have a unique power that triggers whenever they walk. It may appear as if the xvarts are teleporting from one place to another, but I have learned their power's true nature. Xvarts actually stop time for several seconds when they walk. The best way to fight xvarts would be to get close to them so they do not have to walk to you."

"Tasloi-Other relatives to kobolds, tasloi have a gaze attack. Any creature that looks a tasloi in the eye may be driven berserk, possibly attacking an ally. This will not happen if one does not make eye contact with the tasloi, or if one is more than 15 feet away."

"Hobgoblins-The supreme accuracy of the common hobgoblin with their sword is well known. Even heavy armor likely will not stop a hobgoblin. However, these creatures do not possess anywhere near the same precision with their bows. Combating hobgoblins at long range will likely be easier than fighting them up close."

"Spellcasting Hobgoblins-Some hobgoblins can also cast spells. They are unnaturally good at casting their spells, as if an archmage was casting the spell."

"Ogrillions-Although related to half-ogres, ogrillions have completely different powers. They move fast, and their punch carries enough force to knock victims approximately 30 feet away, though I have never measured the exact distance."

"Half-Ogres-The offspring of an ogre and a human, half-ogres are born with an impenetrable skin. Far better than the most perfect armor, half-ogre skin makes them nearly impossible to hit by most means. I advise using magic, which will get past their skin just fine."

"Ogres-Even these dumb brutes have powers. Ogres have abilities they can use when an opponent comes near. The ogre can either make its attacks critically effective, make itself more resistant to physical harm, release a terrifying roar, make its attacks hit with extreme force, or make its attacks slay creatures instantly. Only one of these abilities is used at a time, and it is chosen randomly, no matter which one would be the best at the time."

"Greater Ogres-These ogres are halfway to being hill giants. Unlike normal ogres, a Greater Ogre can use more than one of its abilities at once. A Greater Ogre also possesses a unique aura, which causes creatures around it to become even stupider than the ogre. This effect is thankfully only temporary."~
@17203=~Elminster's Ecologies II~
@17204=~Elminster's Ecologies-Mammals

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about mammals. From the introduction:

"Some druids have already written impressive texts about mammals, but those are written from a druid's perspective. This book is directed at adventurers, and is focused primarily on the dangers many mammals pose."

One chapter describes mammals that may be found on the Sword Coast:

"Rabbits-Although small and frail, rabbits possess extremely sharp teeth. They are also very lucky, as they usually have two rabbit feet."

"Squirrels-When a squirrel dies an early death, it explodes in an enormous fireball. Thankfully, few creatures attack squirrels for fear that they could be incinerated. Occasionly, though, an ogre comes across a squirrel and has a bad idea..."

"Rats-The glare of a rat causes confusion. Though rats are not much of a threat."

"Cats-Extremely resistant to physical attacks, a cat has the power to turn another creature into a rat. It can only do this once per day."

"Wild Dogs-Undomesticated dogs, these animals have the power to slow a creature, making time pass slower for it."

"War Dogs-These trained dogs have different abilities from wild dogs. Rather than slowing a creature, they can speed it up, allowing an ally to move and attack very quickly."

"Wolves-Wolves have been long known for their camouflage. They stay hidden but will reveal themselves right before they attack. Regular wolves also have the power to make their attacks critically effective."

"Dire Wolves-Bigger than normal wolves, these ones also stalk in camouflage, but their other abilities are different. After revealing themselves, they burst into a whirlwind of attacks. For regular adventurers, it is best to run away until the dire wolf stops its flurry."

"Worgs-Wolves with a more sinister streak, worgs are known for allying with goblins, who use them as mounts. Worg camouflage has a special property: any creature mounted on the worg is camouflaged along with it. Worgs can also summon another worg; the additional worg does not have this summoning ability."

"Winter Wolves-Unlike normal wolves, winter wolves turn fully invisible rather than using camouflage. They have the ability to breathe cold at other creatures; this breath weapon also temporarily makes the target more vulnerable to cold. Furthermore, once their breath reaches the target, they turn invisible again. Thus, they are only visible while their breath is on its way to the target. Though winter wolves are vulnerable to fire, the easiest way to combat them is to use magic to see through their invisibility."

"Black Bears-These bears are imbued with the power of acid. Whenever a black bear is hurt, it retaliates with a spray of acid at the attacker."

"Brown Bears-These bears crackle with electricity. Whenever a brown bear is hurt, it retaliates with a bolt of lightning at the attacker."

"Cave Bears-These bears have fire burning beneath their fur. Whenever a cave bear is hurt, it retaliates with a ball of fire centered on itself."

"Polar Bears-These bears have an affinity for cold. Whenever a polar bear is hurt, it retaliates with a cone of extreme cold at the attacker."

"Grizzly Bears-These bears are especially powerful, being imbued with multiple elements. Whenever a grizzly bear is hurt, it retaliates with a blast of fire, cold, electricity, and acid."~
@17205=~Elminster's Ecologies III~
@17206=~Elminster's Ecologies-Spiders

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about monstrous spiders.

"Oversized spiders have one power in common: they spawn smaller spiders when they attack another creature. This spawning is not reproduction; it is likely some innate form of conjuration magic. The smaller spiders vanish after about eight hours, as if they were unsummoned. Some of the small spiders are capable of casting spells. Most spiders (excluding Wraith Spiders) are animals, so druids and rangers will have power over them. Spiders almost never miss with their attacks."

A quick look through the book tells you there are many, many different kinds of spiders in the Realms.

"Huge Spiders-These orange spiders are poisonous, as are the spiders they spawn, but they are the weakest of the oversized spiders. Although big, they are still quite stealthy."

"Giant Spiders-These green spiders are particularly poisonous. The spiders they spawn can cast Glitterdust."

"Phase Spiders-These green spiders can teleport to other creatures, and they are among the most poisonous spiders. They spawn spiders that can cast Minor Spell Turning and can also teleport."

"Sword Spiders-These gray spiders are among the swiftest creatures in the Realms, capable of moving and attacking at unbelievable speeds. Their poison, rather than causing bodily harm, weakens the victim's reflexes. The smaller spiders they create are similarly fast."

"Wraith Spiders-These black spiders are undead. Rather than inflicting poison, these spiders inflict a disease that saps the victim's strength. The spiders they summon on hit are especially dangerous, as they can cast Harm, reducing a creature to a near-death state."

"Vorpal Spiders-These green spiders, rather than using a poisonous bite, slash with their poisonous legs. Their attacks have a good chance to decapitate the target, causing instant death (a Death Ward spell can stop this from happening). Vorpal Spiders react to being attacked by speeding up temporarily, moving and attacking faster. They are resistant to magic and physical attacks."

"Astral Phase Spiders-Often used by githyanki in their raids, these spiders have all the powers of Phase Spiders, but they also have psionic abilities."

One chapter focuses on related monsters called ettercaps.

"Ettercaps-These creatures ally themselves with spiders, and they are similarly venomous. Ettercaps are dangerous spellcasters, capable of casting multiple spells with no pause in between. The most common ettercap first casts Greater Malison twice to soften up its victims, and then casts Hold Person to paralyze them."

"Ettercap Tremor Callers-These rare ettercaps have the power to trigger earthquakes. They move in to eat once their victims are knocked down."

"Ettercap Hasteners-These rare ettercaps possess a twisted form of the spell Improved Haste, which will speed up time for a creature to such an extent that the creature quickly decays during the effect."~
@17207=~Elminster's Ecologies IV~
@17208=~Elminster's Ecologies-Monstrous Beasts

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about the more animalistic monsters.

Even a quick look through the book finds many desciptions of exotic monsters, such as "land sharks" whose psionic powers compel prey to walk into their enormous jaws.

Of particular interest is a chapter titled "Monstrous Beasts on the Sword Coast."

"Wyverns-Flying beasts distantly related to dragons, wyverns attack with their poisonous tail stinger. Their scales, although easier to penetrate than a real dragon's scales, will still stop most attacks. They can also breathe slippery grease, which spreads all over the ground and slows down prey fleeing from the wyvern. The wyverns can simply fly over the grease."

"Greater Wyverns-Especially large and intelligent, Greater Wyverns can cast spells. They also retaliate with a wing buffet when attacked."

"Greatest Wyverns-Among the most dangerous wyverns, Greatest Wyverns spawn a smaller wyvern with each attack they make."

"Basilisks-These 8-legged lizards have petrifying gaze. Any creature that makes eye contact with a basilisk while within 15 feet may be turned to stone permanently. Looking away from the basilisk will prevent this from happening. Basilisks are also usually protected by Stoneskin."

"Greater Basilisks-The petrifying gaze of more powerful basilisks is harder to resist. They can also cast Dispel Magic on creatures that are protected from petrification. By staying close to the basilisk, one can trick it into dispelling its own protection."

"Ankhegs-These insectoid creatures can burrow underground, and they can spit acid at their prey. Their chitinous hide provides them excellent protection. There are several different kinds of ankhegs."

"Light Ankhegs-These ankhegs spit acid especially quickly. They are smaller and frailer than other ankhegs, though."

"Heavy Ankhegs-The acid of a heavy ankheg clings to the target and continues to harm them over time. They attack slowly."

"Arcane Ankhegs-These intelligent ankhegs can cast spells. They will have to emerge from the ground to cast a spell on another creature."

"Greater Ankhegs-Each kind of ankheg has a more powerful version. Greater Light Ankhegs attack faster than their normal counterparts. Greater Heavy Ankhegs possess deadlier acid. And Greater Arcane Ankhegs have much more powerful spells. If one can find a greater ankheg and slay it, its shell could be made into a great suit of armor."

"Carrion Crawlers-Many-legged, centipede-like creatures, Carrion Crawlers attack with paralyzing tentacles. They can also cast divine spells, usually Physical Mirror, Blade Barrier and Flame Strike. However, apart from their spells, Carrion Crawlers have few defenses, and they are not very tenacious."~
@17209=~Elminster's Ecologies V~
@17210=~Elminster's Ecologies-Undead

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about the undead.

"Skeletons-Animated skeletons differ greatly in their powers, but most of them have a power in common: when struck, the skeleton will fall apart but its skull will remain animate. The skulls also have varying powers."

"Zombies-These walking corpses devour the brains of their victims. Most normal zombies have a common power: any creature that hits the zombie with an attack or spell gets pulled to the zombie. There are also more powerful zombies, which have much more diverse abilities."

"Ghouls-Ghouls can turn invisible, and their touch causes paralysis. Ghouls almost never miss."

"Greater Ghouls-These powerful ghouls attack and move faster, and they usually have Stoneskins. They tend to attack in groups."

"Ghasts-Stronger than ghouls but weaker than greater ghouls, Ghasts tend to wander around an area while invisible until they come close to prey or they take damage. Some ghasts can also summon other ghasts, though this summoning is silent and there may be a delay until the second ghast appears. I warn you: if you fight a ghast, expect to fight another ghast within minutes, if not within seconds!"

"Greater Ghast Lords-The most powerful undead carrion eaters, Greater Ghast Lords have a stench comparable to a Stinking Cloud, which can knock living creatures unconscious."

"Revenants-After a creature is killed in a terrible way, its soul can inhabit a body and become a revenant, determined to kill its killer. Revenants have a power that inflicts utter hopelessness on their enemies. They tend to prioritize attacking the creature against whom they have sworn vengeance."

"Vengeful Spirits-Similar to revenants but without a corporeal form, Vengeful Spirits tend to arise immediately after certain creatures die, seeking revenge on the one who just killed them. They are relatively weak, but as they are spirits, only magic or magical weapons can hurt them, and they can move through walls. Vengeful Spirits can usually cast either Spiritual Lock, which temporarily prevents a creature's mind from working (as if the creature was feebleminded), or Ethereal Retribution, which calls a flock of other life-draining spirits."

"Shadows-Spectral undead resembling humanoid shadows (except they can have height as well), shadows drain victims' strength away with their attacks. In addition, shadows can enfeeble creatures, possibly preventing those creatures from moving and making it easier to drain the last of their strength. They cannot be hit by non-magical weapons, and they can move through walls."

"Greater Shadows-More powerful than typical shadows, Greater Shadows have a particularly dangerous enfeebling ability, which weakens multiple creatures."

"Wraiths-Undead made of negative energy, Wraiths can drain the life out of multiple creatures at once by casting Soul Eater. Living creatures are harmed merely by standing near a wraith."

"Death Shades-Weak but dangerous lesser undead creatures, Death Shades seek to give living things an early death. Any creature hit by a Death Shade will die instantly unless it is protected by a Death Ward. However, Death Shades will be destroyed upon suffering even the slightest harm, and they are reckless and easy to hit. Much more corporeal than other spectral undead, Death Shades can be hurt by normal weapons, and they cannot move through walls."

"Greater Death Shades-Far more dangerous than normal death shades, these creatures can cast Wave of Destruction, a negative energy wave which can slay creatures up to 120 feet away who are not protected by a Death Ward. They are usually protected by Mirror Images and a Greater Globe of Invulerability, but they still are destroyed upon suffering any harm. They can cast Dispel Magic to dispel a Death Ward, but if you stay near them you can trick them into dispelling their own protections as well."~
@17211=~Elminster's Ecologies VI~
@17212=~Elminster's Ecologies-Constructs

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about golems and other constructs. From the introduction:

"Two primary categories of constructs exist. There are animated object constructs, which are usually a floating weapon or suit of armor. Then there are golems, akin to giants but made entirely of one material. Most constructs are weak to acid and blunt attacks, though there are exceptions."

One chapter describes common animated object constructs:

"Helmed Horrors-Especially intelligent, Helmed Horrors can cast the spell Disintegrate. They usually wield morningstars that make the target more vulnerable to disintegration."

"Battle Horrors-Possibly the most dangerous of the animated object constructs, Battle Horrors are animated suits of full plate armor which dual wield a flaming sword and a freezing sword. They cannot deal damage to a creature protected from both fire and cold, but they will cast Lower Resistance on such a creature. They also can make their attacks critically effective. Running from a Battle Horror is difficult, because they teleport to their enemies."

"Doom Guards-These constructs are animated suits of plate mail which wield bows, even when a creature fights them in melee. They fire piercing arrows that can hit multiple targets, and any creature hit by one of their arrows is afflicted by feelings of impending doom."

"Dwarven Doom Guards-These Doom Guards are made to look like dwarven plate armor, and they wield acidic returning throwing axes. Like other Doom Guards, they inflict feelings of doom with each hit. They are extremely resistant to all physical damage; using spells is the best option to defeat them."

Another chapter describes various golems:

"Flesh Golems-The weakest golems (though among the most intelligent), Flesh Golems move fast and punch with great force, but they are vulnerable to physical attacks, fire, and acid. If a Flesh Golem would be hit by a Flesh to Stone spell, it turns into a Stone Golem."

"Stone Golems-These golems are resistant to most physical attacks, and they can temporarily slow time for opponents. If a Stone Golem would be hit by a Stone to Flesh spell (or a Stone to Flesh Scroll), it turns into a Flesh Golem."

"Magic Golems-Made of magic itself, these golems are immune to all magic and can only be hurt by non-magical weapons. Not surprisingly, they can cast many different spells."~
@17213=~Elminster's Ecologies VII~
@17214=~Elminster's Ecologies-Slimes

Written by the sage Elminster, this tome is part of a much larger body of work containing studies of strange creatures from around Toril, and some creatures from other planes. This particular book is about slime creatures. From the introduction:

"Slimes are such varied and dangerous foes that they need their own book to describe them. Most slimes hurl balls of their own slime at enemies with unfailing accuracy. Attacking a slime usually causes a piece of itself to discharge at the attacker, as if the slime had attacked that creature."

One chapter describes slimes that can be found on the Sword Coast:

"Green Slimes-Among the weaker slimes, Green Slimes cover targets in poisonous slime. They cannot be hurt by missiles or electricity."

"Gray Oozes-Gray Oozes hurl gray slime with crushing force. Targets can be stunned and knocked back. They are weak to fire and cold."

"Ochre Jellies-These slimes can knock victims unconscious with their attacks. They are very resistant to all damage, but they are actually most vulnerable to physical damage."

"Mustard Jellies-Attacks from a Mustard Jelly can poison, slow, blind and deafen creatures. They are resistant to magic and physical attacks, but they have no resistance to fire or cold."

"Fission Slimes-These slimes will split in two if they are killed without having been hit by a fire attack. They can only be hurt by fire and physical attacks. Their own attacks are acidic, and they also make creatures more vulnerable to acid."

"Dense Puddings-These slimes split whenever they are hit by fire or electricity. They can only be safely hurt by physical attacks. A Dense Pudding's attacks inflict a disease that saps victims' constitution and slows them."

"Gelatinous Spheres-Quite different from most other slimes, Gelatinous Spheres are transparent and very difficult to see unless one has walked inside one. They corrode anything they touch and any creature inside them. In addition, creatures inside them will become more vulnerable to acid."~

@19001=~Divine Favor
This spell grants the caster a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls per level of the caster. The spell lasts for 2 rounds.~
@19002=~Lay On Hands

Casting Time: 1

The character channels positive energy to heal the touched creature of a number of Hit Points equal to the square of the caster's level, up to a maximum of 100 Hit Points at level 10.~
@19003=~Charm Animal
This spell affects any single animal it is cast upon. The animal is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect. This save is made at a penalty of -1 per level of the ranger.

If the spell's recipient fails its Saving Throw, it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms-or attempts to harm-the charmed animal by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed animal, the spell is broken. If two or more charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it was charmed.~

@19007=~Seeking Sword
This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon and provides a +4 THAC0 bonus, but no damage bonus. When it hits a creature, it removes all Mirror Image and Improved Invisibility effects on the creature. It deals 2d4 damage to any target it hits. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level. While it is equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.~
@19008=~Force Dispel Magic~
@19009=~Force Dispel Magic

Casting Time: 4

Yeslick's Force Dispel Magic ability allows him to dispel all dispellable effects on the target creature. Unlike the regular Dispel Magic, this ability always has a 100% chance of succeeding.~
@19010=~Spiritual Hammer
(Invocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By calling upon Tempus, Branwen brings into existence a magical hammer, which she can use for the duration. As with her priest spells, Branwen counts as eight levels higher than normal when using this innate ability. As a result, the hammer she summons is more powerful. At levels 1 to 4, it is a +2 weapon. At levels 5 and above, it is a +3 weapon. The Spiritual Hammer uses the warhammer proficiency. Like a war hammer, the Spiritual Hammer deals 1d4+1 base damage (plus enchantment bonuses), but it can also be used to attack enemies from far away. When it is swung from far away, the hammer still counts as a crushing weapon, not a missile weapon. It does not get any penalties when swung at a foe in melee range.~

@19069=~Berserking Gaze

Casting Time: 0

The tasloi's Berserking Gaze will cause a target to become afflicted with Blood Rage for 5 rounds unless it makes a successful Save vs. Breath.

Blood Rage is an even more savage form of berserk in which the character immediately attacks the nearest creature even if they weren't previously in combat. It is preferable to use this ability on enemies rather than allies, in the hopes of making enemies attack each other.~

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were chain mail armor (AC 5). It is cumulative with Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield bonus. The Armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and doesn't prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until its duration expires.~
@20103=~Burning Hands
(Alteration)

Level: 1

Duration: Instant 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: <PRO_HISHER> thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. The target suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. A creature that successfully saves vs. Spell receives half damage. The flames travel in a cone that can be very large if the target is far away.~

Saving Throw: Neg.

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand and travel 50 feet before disappearing. Any creature within 50 feet that gets hit by the spell must Save vs. Spell or become stunned for 2 rounds. This effect can only happen if either 1: the creature has 2 Hit Dice or less, or 2: the creature has fewer Hit Dice than the caster has levels, up to a maximum of 9 Hit Dice for a level 10 caster.~

Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

A Friends spell sets the wizard's Charisma to 20. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with <PRO_HIMHER> and make an effort to be <PRO_HISHER> friends and help <PRO_HIMHER>, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking <PRO_HIMHER> captive instead.~

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular 1st-level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every 2 extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile-<PRO_HESHE> has 2 at 3rd level, 3 at 5th level, 4 at 7th level, up to a total of 11 at 21st level.~

When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard. It sets the wizard's Armor Class to 4 against all melee weapons, and 2 against missile weapons. It also grants the wizard immunity from the spells Magic Missile and Many Missiles. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@20115=~Shocking Grasp
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1d8 points of damage plus 2 per level of the caster to the creature touched. On a critical hit or a backstab, the electricity damage is doubled, unless the critical hit or backstab is averted. In addition, the touch attack itself does 1d2 fist damage (Strength bonuses apply, as does any effect that increases the damage of unarmed attacks). The touch attack counts as a +6 weapon for purposes of determining what it can hit. The wizard only has one charge, and once an opponent has been touched, the spell's energies have been used. The wizard gets a +10 bonus to hit the target, but if <PRO_HESHE> misses, the spell is wasted. The wizard has 1 round per level to touch the target creature.~
@20116=~Sleep
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When a wizard casts a Sleep spell, <PRO_HESHE> causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more enemies (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). All creatures to be affected by the Sleep spell must be within a 15-ft. radius. Creatures in the area of effect must make a Saving Throw vs. Death with a -3 penalty or fall asleep. Monsters with 10 Hit Dice or more are unaffected. Attacks against sleeping opponents never miss, though they will wake upon taking damage.~
@20117=~Chill Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

After casting this spell, the caster's next attack against a creature inflicts a necrotic chill. This deals 5d4 magic cold damage, and the target must Save vs. Death or lose 3 points of Strength for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative; if the creature is reduced to 0 Strength, it dies instantly. On a critical hit or a backstab, the damage and Strength loss are doubled, unless the critical hit or backstab is averted. The wizard gets a +5 bonus to hit the target, but if <PRO_HESHE> misses, the spell is wasted. In addition, the touch attack itself does 1d2 fist damage (Strength bonuses apply, as does any effect that increases the damage of unarmed attacks). The touch attack counts as a +6 weapon for purposes of determining what it can hit. The wizard only has one charge, and once an opponent has been touched, the spell's energies have been used. The wizard gets a +10 bonus to hit the target, but if <PRO_HESHE> misses, the spell is wasted. An undead creature suffers no damage or Strength loss from Chill Touch, but will be affected by panic for 2 turns unless it successfully makes a Save vs. Death.~
@20119=~Larloch's Minor Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 8 damage, while the Mage gains 8 Hit Points. If the Mage goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses any extra Hit Points after 1 hour.~
@20123=~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and half the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 12 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 9 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 4 Hit Points. The caster now has 16 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 4 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 12), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 4 damage.

Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of mansize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 7.5 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who save vs. Spell at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@20309=~Summon Kobold
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

With the casting of this spell, the wizard summons a single kobold, chosen at random from the following:

Kobold Magic Hurler (Hurls Magic Missiles at enemies)
Terrifying Kobold (Has an aura of fear; each round, enemies within 9 feet must Save vs. Spell at +6 or run away for 1 round)
Blinding Kobold (Can cast Blindness at will, though it has a longer casting time)~
@20311=~Protection From Missiles 
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard becomes surrounded by a magical, purple cylinder which protects <PRO_HIMHER> from missile attacks. What constitutes a "missile" for the purposes of the protection includes arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, most thrown weapons, and the natural weapons of certain monsters. The projectiles launched by spells such as Magic Missile do not count as missiles. The shield blocks half of the missile damage directed at the wizard, effectively giving <PRO_HIMHER> 50% missile resistance. Multiple castings of the spell will not give the wizard additional missile resistance, but the effect will stack with missile resistance granted by other spells and items.~
@20313=~Skull Trap
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 10 ft. of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes damaging everyone within a 15-ft. radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 per level of the caster (to a maximum of 10d6), or half with a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party lest they set it off accidentally.~
@20316=~Dire Charm
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

The Dire Charm spell is similar to the lower-level spell Charm Person, but with two difference: There is no bonus to the saving throw, and the spell can affect giant humanoids such ogres in addition to smaller humanoids.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw vs. Spell, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms-or attempts to harm-the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Dire Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~
@20319=~Protection From Fire
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it confers 50% resistance to all sources of fire damage, whether magical or nonmagical. The spell lasts for 2 turns or until dispelled.

@20320=~Protection From Cold
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it confers 50% resistance to all sources of cold damage, whether magical or nonmagical. The spell lasts for 2 turns or until dispelled.

@20321=~Spell Thrust
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Spell Thrust is the bane of all Globes of Invulnerability. When Spell Thrust is cast upon a creature, it will remove the following three spells: Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Globe of Invulnerability, and Improved Globe of Invulnerability. Innate Globes of Invulnerability will also be destroyed as well. Spell Thrust will also remove the effects of a Potion of Magic Blocking or a Protection from Magic scroll. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@20322=~Detect Illusion
(Divination)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell will cancel all illusionary protections on enemies in the area of effect. In addition it will dispel all forms of Invisibility and Mirror Image, even if originating from an innate ability instead of a spell. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The targets' Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@20324=~Hold Undead
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemies within 10 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds one or more undead creatures rigidly immobile and in place. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any enemies within 10 ft. of the target are also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds.~
@20401=~Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell, whereas those who fail their Saving Throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The spell lasts for 6 rounds.~
@20407=~Summon Small Monster
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4

Kobold Commando (Shoots +2 fire arrows and can cast Greater Whirlwind Attack once)
Tasloi (Has accurate melee attacks, and its gaze drives creatures berserk)
Earth Mephit (Resists crushing attacks, has Aura Cleansing, can cast Stone Spit for 1d6 crushing damage three times)
Small Troll (High HP, regenerates 1 HP per second but takes double damage from fire and acid)~

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 20
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature if it does not make a successful Save vs. Poison at a -4 penalty. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and Charisma scores are reduced by 4. The afflicted character is also Slowed. These effects persist until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.~
@20412=~Greater Malison
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The spell allows the caster to adversely affect all the Saving Throws of <PRO_HISHER> enemies. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect. Opponents under the influence of this spell make all Saving Throws at a penalty of -4. Multiple Greater Malison spells stack, giving the recipients additional saving throw penalties.~
@20413=~Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell encloses the target in a globe of shimmering force for the duration of the spell. The resilient sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world. Hostile creatures can resist the effect with Magic Resistance, but there is no Saving Throw.~
@20415=~Polymorph Other
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Line of sight of caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. 

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, but all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a Save vs. Polymorph is made successfully. Like a normal squirrel, the target will explode on death. The transformation lasts 8 hours or until a Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~
@20416=~Polymorph Self
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. The caster gains the Strength, Dexterity and Constitution on the creature (unless the caster's stats are higher, in which case they don't change), as well as the abilities and resistances of the creature. For the duration of the spell, the caster can transform into any of the new forms at any time and as many times as <PRO_HESHE> wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others.

The possible forms given by Polymorph Self are:
- Lesser Basilisk: Can petrify creatures that make eye contact with the character
- Ankheg: Can burrow underground and spit acid at creatures
- Troll: Regenerates 2 Hit Points per second but is vulnerable to fire and acid
- Phase Spider: Can teleport at will and poison foes
- Winter Wolf: Turns invisible on transformation and can breathe cold at foes while lowering their cold resistance~
@20417=~Enchanted Weapon
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast on a creature, it enchants any weapons that it currently wields. For the duration of the spell, those weapons are treated as having a +6 enchantment for the purposes of determining what they can hit. This spell does not make the weapons deal extra damage or hit more accurately, but it lets them hit creatures which can only be hit by weapons of +6 or higher (such as a mage under the protection of Absolute Immunity).~
@20420=~Minor Sequencer
(All)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to store multiple spells and activate them both at the same time from <PRO_HISHER> Special Ability button. All of them must be level 1 spells. To create a sequencer, the caster must memorize not only Minor Sequencer but also the spells <PRO_HESHE> intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which <PRO_HESHE> still has spell slots). After casting Minor Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those <PRO_HESHE> has memorized. The caster can store 3 spells in a Minor Sequencer, plus an additional spell per 5 levels, to a maximum of 6 spells at level 15.

A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Ability icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A spellcaster can possess only one Minor Sequencer at a time, and it may not be given to other characters.~
@20423=~Spider Spawn
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard must throw a spider egg into the air while saying the final command word. The result is that the egg morphs into a fully grown spider that will remain under the wizard's telepathic control. The type of spider that appears depends upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.
 7th: huge spider.
 15th: giant spider.
 20th+: sword spider.
The spiders summoned by this spell have fewer hit points than the regular versions of those spiders, but they are just as powerful in every other way. Like the normal versions of the spiders, they summon a small spider whenever they hit a creature with an attack. These small spiders are under the control of the caster as well. The large spider will be unsummoned after 5 rounds, but the small spiders it summons will last for 8 hours.~
@20424=~Farsight
(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: Special
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: Instant 
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When Farsight is cast, the caster is able to view an area of an unexplored map. After casting the spell, simply click on a section of the map that you want to view. For the duration of the spell, the caster can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications. Farsight has no casting time, can be cast immediately after another spell, and can be cast while the game is paused.~
@20425=~Wizard Eye
(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends <PRO_HIMHER> visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts, and while outside it can fly over normally impassable areas. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell.~

@20501=~Animate Dead
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a skeleton warrior to rise and serve the caster under any conditions. The type of skeleton warrior that appears depends upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.
  1st - 6th: a 3 HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword.
  7th - 10th: a 5 HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword +1.
  11th - 14th: a 7 HD skeleton warrior wielding a bastard sword +1.

@20504=~Summon Large Monster
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

With the casting of this spell, the wizard summons a large monster, chosen at random from the following:

Ogre (Uses Critical Strike, Hardiness, War Cry or Smite, chosen at random)
Minotaur (A solid fighter who has 2 mirror images and can cast Summon Insects once)
Hook Horror (A mage who has Aura Cleansing and a couple of low-level spells)~
@20506=~Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals. In addition, unlike Mental Domination, the wizard spell Domination gives the caster access to the creature's senses, allowing the caster to see what the creature sees. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The target is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect. Elves and half-elves do not have any innate resistance to Domination as they do to charm effects.~
@20507=~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemies within 7.5 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for 9 or more rounds, unless a Saving Throw vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any enemies within 7.5 ft. of the target are also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, diseases, or poison.~
@20508=~Chaos
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th-level spell Confusion in all respects. The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking either friend or foe. If the victim is 4th level or lower, <PRO_HESHE> does not receive a Saving Throw vs. the effects. However, if the victim is 5th level or higher, <PRO_HESHE> receives a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty. The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful Dispel Magic is cast.~
@20509=~Feeblemind
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 9 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate into that of a simple beast of burden unless a Saving Throw vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. Upon a failed Saving Throw, the subject remains in this state until a Dispel Magic is cast upon <PRO_HIMHER>. Feeblemind is particularly vulnerable to Dispel Magic; any Dispel Magic spell will have a 100% percent chance of removing the effects of Feeblemind, no matter the level of the dispeller.~
@20513=~Breach
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast at a creature, it breaches and dispels all of the specific and combat protections of 5th level or lower on the target creature. Here is a complete list of all the specific protection spells that are dispelled by Breach: Shield, Protection Circle, Resist Fear, Protection From Fire/Cold, Fireshield, Protection From Acid, and Protection From Electricity. The combat protection spells dispelled by Breach are Protection From Normal Missiles, Protection From Normal Weapons, Stoneskin, Armor, Ghost Armor, and Spirit Armor. The spell will remove all stoneskin effects from the target, whether they are from a combat protection spell or not. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

In addition, the spell breaches the target's Armor Class, lowering it by 20. This lasts 2 turns.~
@20514=~Lower Resistance
(Abjuration)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 9 rounds + 1 round/level after 9th
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast upon a target creature, this spell will lower the target's resistance to magic, as well as its resistance to all damage types except poison, by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. There is no Saving Throw, and the target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell: If Lower Resistance was cast upon the same creature twice by a level 9 caster, the creature's resistances would be lowered by a total of 38%. This spell will last until its duration expires and cannot be dispelled.~
@20515=~Oracle
(Divination)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to predict enemies' spells. For the duration, whenever a non-allied creature in the current area begins casting a spell, the caster will immediately be informed of the name of the spell being cast.~
@20516=~Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

A wizard who casts a Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental spell summons a fire elemental to do <PRO_HISHER> bidding. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell's duration expires, or the elemental dies. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. During the contest, the wizard cannot take action (Remove Paralysis does not remove this effect) and the elemental cannot be charmed. At the end of this time, the caster usually wins and gains control of the elemental. ~
@20518=~Phantom Blade
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The silent, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict damage just as those of a real sword do. The phantom blade uses the longsword proficiency, but it makes the caster proficient in longswords if <PRO_HESHE> is not already proficient (if the caster has a higher proficiency, it does not reduce the proficiency).

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. However, due to its etheric nature, it causes an extra +10 damage against undead creatures. In addition, it can be used to attack any creature in sight. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@20520=~Conjure Lesser Air Elemental

The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. During the contest, the wizard cannot take action (Remove Paralysis does not remove this effect) and the elemental cannot be charmed. At the end of this time, the caster usually wins and gains control of the elemental.~

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

A wizard who casts a Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental spell summons an earth elemental to do <PRO_HISHER> bidding. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell's duration expires, or the elemental dies. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. During the contest, the wizard cannot take action (Remove Paralysis does not remove this effect) and the elemental cannot be charmed. At the end of this time, the caster usually wins and gains control of the elemental.~

(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a Saving Throw vs. Petrification to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to attacks of any sort, it will shatter into tiny pieces, making it impossible for the creature to be returned to flesh. The reverse of this spell may be cast upon the victim in order to restore life, but this is the only way.~
@20608=~Pierce Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast upon a target creature, there will be two major effects: First, the creature's Magic Resistance, if any, will be lowered by 100%; second, all spell protections of 6th level or lower affecting the creature, if any, will be canceled.

The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spells that were chosen will be cast automatically.

A limitation of this spell is that the target of the spells placed in the contingency must be the caster: Therefore, they may not be offensive spells, nor may they target any other party members.~

The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. During the contest, the wizard cannot take action (Remove Paralysis does not remove this effect) and the elemental cannot be charmed.

(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast, it confers 200% resistance to all elemental attacks: fire, cold, and electricity, though not from supernatural forms of magic fire or magic cold. This level of resistance causes incoming elemental damage to be absorbed, healing the target rather than dealing damage.~
@20704=~Ruby Ray Of Reversal
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The magical ray produced by this spell will invert the target's resistance to all damage types except for poison and magic damage. Thus, if the spell were to be cast on a fire elemental with 100% fire resistance and 50% weakness to cold, it would then have 50% cold resistance and 100% weakness to fire. This spell only affects innate resistances; resistances from items and other spells do not get reversed. Ruby Ray of Reversal has no effect on golems and other creatures with immutable form.~

This spell allows a spellcaster to store a single spell of 2nd level or lower. The stored spell may then be instantly cast three times. The three castings of the spell can target different creatures, or they could all target the same creature.

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster

This spell allows a spellcaster to store spells in a magical ability (accessed via the Special Ability button) that is created by the spell. This item, the trigger, can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 4th level or lower. A spellcaster can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger may not be given to other characters. Once the spell trigger is used, the icon will disappear from the Special Ability button.

Sequencer Touch is unique among sequencers in that it requires the caster to touch the creature <PRO_HESHE> wants to unleash the spells on. The caster does not need to make a successful melee attack against the target to activate the spells, but <PRO_HESHE> needs to be right next to the target. Spells which require the caster to make a successful melee attack will not work with Sequencer Touch.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature

Furthermore, it raises their morale by the same amount. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special

The Command spell lets the caster give another creature a command and force it to carry out that command. The creature is effectively controlled by the party for 1 round. There is no save if the target has 9 Hit Dice or less; if they have more, they can avoid the effects with a successful Save vs. Spell. This spell can even command undead and constructs, though the spell Chaotic Commands will still block it, and elves and half-elves have resistance.~

Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: Special

Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and an arrow of fire that deals 1d6+2 piercing plus 1d6 fire damage will deal 1d6+2 piercing plus 1d5 fire damage instead. The priest's enemies suffer the opposite effects. All the bonuses and penalties increase by one for every three caster levels past level 3, to a maximum of +5 or -5 at level 15.

Multiple chants are not cumulative.~
@21204=~Charm Person or Animal
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal 
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 person or animal
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects any single person or animal it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible. Persons get a +3 bonus to the save but animals do not.

If the caster harms-or attempts to harm-the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~
@21206=~Flame Blade
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 0 
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels 
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. The blade uses the scimitar proficiency, but it will make the caster proficient with scimitars if <PRO_HESHE> is not already proficient with them. The blade deals no physical damage, but it deals 4d8 fire damage with each hit and will deal double damage on a critical hit just like a normal weapon would. It counts as a +1 weapon for determining what it can hit, but it does not get an enchantment bonus to hit or damage. It does not get any bonus to damage from Strength, but it will get a THAC0 bonus when wielded by a strong character. Effects that cause a character to deal maximum damage will not cause this weapon to deal maximum damage.~
@21208=~Hold Person
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Charm 
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemy within 4 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn.

Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1

(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is placed upon a creature, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. Complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flametongue swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by regular fire or cold reduced by 50%, and damage from magic fire or magic cold is reduced by 25%. Note that most fire and cold spells do not do magic fire or magic cold damage.~

(Invocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

By calling upon <PRO_HISHER> deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer, which <PRO_HESHE> can use for the duration of the spell. At levels 1 to 6, it is a +1 weapon. At levels 7 to 12, it is a +2 weapon. At levels 13 and above, it is a +3 weapon. The Spiritual Hammer uses the warhammer proficiency, but like other magically-created weapons, it gives the wielder proficiency with it if <PRO_HESHE> isn't already. Like a war hammer, the Spiritual Hammer deals 1d4+1 base damage (plus enchantment bonuses), but it can also be used to attack enemies from far away. When it is swung from far away, the hammer still counts as a crushing weapon, not a missile weapon.~
@21214=~Draw Upon Holy Might
(Invocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat 
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

The priest calls upon <PRO_HISHER> god to grant <PRO_HIMHER> power for a short period. When <PRO_HESHE> does this, <PRO_HISHER> Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity are all raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster, to a maximum increase of 5 at level 15. A 3rd-level caster would have <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 1, while a 12th-level caster would have <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 4.~
@21250=~Writhing Fog

Level: 3
Sphere: Animal 
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: 2 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemies within 4 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds animals rigidly immobile and in place. Only normal- and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell; monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster; every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws at -3 are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@21306=~Protection From Fire

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level

It also gives 40% resistance against the rare sources of magical fire damage. This spell does not stack with itself, but it does stack with similar spells such as Resist Fire/Cold.~

Saving Throw: None

Certain invisible creatures within the area of effect have their invisibility dispelled. This includes creatures under the effects of Sanctuary, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Invisibility, Mislead, and so on. The kinds of creatures that have their invisibility dispelled depend on the allegiance of the caster. If the caster is a party member or an ally, all enemies and neutral creatures (creatures with a whitish blue circle) will be revealed. If the caster is an enemy, party members, allies and neutral creatures will be revealed. If the caster is a neutral creature, everyone except for the caster will be revealed. Invisibility Purge also prevents the revealed creatures from going invisible for 3 rounds.~

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

Defensive Harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enchanted coordination on their attacks and defenses. This allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter. The effect is always centered on the caster, but affects all those within a 15-ft. radius.

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere.

A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage but does not prevent the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage from Spirit Fire.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays <PRO_HISHER> hands upon a creature and heals 40 points of damage from wounds or other injuries.

Saving Throw: Special

When the priest casts a Raise Dead spell, <PRO_HESHE> can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, elf, half-orc, or human.

@21506=~Iron Skins
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a Druid casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the Druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the Druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level Druid would receive 5 skins. For each skin the Druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level Druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER> but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the Druid until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell's duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the Druid from any area attacks such as Fireball; however, it will protect <PRO_HIMHER> from physical magical attacks such as Magic Missile.~
@21507=~Champion's Strength
(Alteration)

Level: 5 
Sphere: Law
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spells is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of <PRO_HISHER> god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to <PRO_HISHER> THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster. So a 9th level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on. Also the target's Strength is set to 25 for the duration of the spell and receives all the bonuses to hit and damage rolls that this Strength confers.

The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and <PRO_HISHER> god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~
@21509=~Magic Resistance

Range: Touch

Slay Living has no effect on undead, constructs or extraplanar creatures.~
@21512=~Greater Command
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Sphere: Charm 
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

As with the 1st-level spell Command, this spell enables the priest to command other creatures, except that the effects are harder to resist (Save vs. Spell at -4 negates), affect multiple creatures, and last three times as long, allowing for multiple commands.

Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm. This swarm will jump first to the target, then to the nearest allies of the target's, until up to 6 creatures have been affected. A creature targeted by this spell can avoid its effects if it manages to make a Save vs. Spell at -10. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible (100% chance of spell failure). Creatures in the insect plague sustain 1 point of damage every 2 seconds they remain within regardless of their Armor Class, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. Due to the suffocating nature of the writhing insect swarm, each victim must make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon or run away in fear for 1 round.~
@21550=~Recall Spirit
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Summoning

@22020=~Ruby Ray Of Reversal
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The magical ray produced by this spell will invert the target's resistance to all damage types except for poison and magic damage. Thus, if the spell were to be cast on a fire elemental with 100% fire resistance and 50% weakness to cold, it would then have 50% cold resistance and 100% weakness to fire. This spell only affects innate resistances; resistances from items and other spells do not get reversed. Ruby Ray of Reversal has no effect on golems and other creatures with immutable form.

(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature

@22028=~Xzar's Energy Drain

Casting Time: 3

The casting of this spell opens a channel between Xzar's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Xzar acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining the victim of 2 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.

Xzar can use this ability at will.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell enables Garrick to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. Since Garrick is treated as ten levels higher for purposes of spell power, this spell will fire two arrows at levels 1-4, three arrows at levels 5-9, and four arrows at levels 10 and above.

Garrick's version of the spell allows him to choose the target of each missile.~
@22037=~Greater Whirlwind Attack

A more powerful version of the Whirlwind Attack, Greater Whirlwind sets the character's number of attacks per round to 10 for one round. The character is considered to be under the effect of Improved Haste for the duration, so <PRO_HISHER> movement speed is doubled.~
@22038=~Critical Strike

A high-level warrior's intimate knowledge of vital spots on opponents allows <PRO_HIMHER> to, once per day, concentrate all of the attacks in one round to strike a vital area every time. With this ability, every attack roll made in the next round is a natural 20, a critical hit.~
@22039=~Stunning Attack

A Stunning Attack allows the warrior to strike blows so forceful that they stun an opponent for 2 rounds if the opponent fails a Save vs. Death at a -4 penalty. The ability lasts for 2 rounds and can be used with melee and ranged weapons.~
@22040=~Hardiness

Calling upon hidden reserves of strength during times of danger, a warrior can use the Hardiness ability to gain 40% resistance to all forms of physical damage. The ability lasts for 1 turn.

This ability does not stack with the Dwarven Defender's Defensive Stance.~
@22041=~War Cry

With a War Cry, the character emits a powerful and frightening yell that will panic all opponents in a 30-ft. radius if they don't make their Save vs. Polymorph. The panic lasts for six rounds. The character's Charisma score determines the difficulty of the saving throw:

Charisma           Saving Throw Bonus/Penalty
1-5                +2
6-9                +1
10-11              0
12-13              -1
14-15              -2
16-17              -3
18-19              -4
20-21              -5
22-24              -6
25                 -7~
@22042=~Smite

With the Smite ability, the warrior gains the ability to strike a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 1 round. The creature can avoid the stun by making a Save vs. Death at a -4 penalty, but there is no save against the knockback. All attacks made in the first round are critical hits. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.

Large creatures such as a dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.~
@22043=~Set Exploding Trap

This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful trap that unleashes a fireball which causes 10d6 damage (Save vs. Spell for half damage) and will knock its victims off their feet.~
@22044=~Set Time Trap

This ability allows the rogue to set a magical trap that casts a weaker version of the high-level Time Stop spell. For 10 seconds, the flow of time slows for all but the rogue. Often, a rogue will use this trap to get behind an opponent for a free attack.~
@22045=~Greater Evasiveness

A more powerful version of Evasiveness, this ability improves Armor Class by 6 and Saving Throws by 3. In addition, Greater Evasiveness allows the character to flawlessly dodge projectiles, giving them an additional +18 AC against missile attacks. Greater Evasiveness lasts for 5 rounds.~
@22046=~Resist Magic

This ability allows the warrior to temporarily tap a great inner strength and fight off the effects of malevolent magic. For 4 rounds, the warrior's Magic Resistance is increased by 50%.~
@22047=~Deathblow

The Deathblow ability allows the warrior to blow through the defenses of any lesser creature. For the next 2 rounds, any creature of 10th level or lower must Save vs. Death or be instantly killed when struck by the warrior.~
@22048=~Rasaad's Searing Orb

Casting Time: 6

When the spell is completed, it creates a glowing stone. This gem must be immediately thrown at an opponent, for it quickly becomes too hot to hold. It is not possible for Rasaad to give the stone to another character to throw. Rasaad must make an attack roll with +3 bonus and no penalty for lack of weapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem can be used to strike any creature, even those hit only by magical weapons, although there is no damage bonus.

When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds it for 1d6 rounds. The victim is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage and to avoid being blinded. Undead creatures suffer 12d6 points of fire damage and are blinded for 12 rounds (if applicable) upon a failed Saving Throw; otherwise, they receive 9d6 points of damage and are blinded for 6 rounds.

Rasaad can create a Searing Orb at will.~
@22049=~Blade Barrier
(Evocation)

Level: 6 
Sphere: Guardian, Creation
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

Branwen employs this spell to set up a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around her, creating an impenetrable barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the Blade Barrier suffers 8d8 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the damage. The barrier remains for 5 rounds.~
@22050=~Flame Strike
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2 

When Branwen calls down a Flame Strike, a vertical column of fire roars downward in the exact location called for by her. The target must roll a Saving Throw vs. Spell. Failure means the creature sustains 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster; otherwise, the damage is halved. As with her priest spells, Branwen is considered to be eight levels higher than normal when casting this innate ability.~
@22061=~Control Undead

Casting Time: 3

The Control Undead spell allows the character to take control of 1-4 undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the character and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 3 Hit Dice or less, then there is no Saving Throw allowed; however, if they have 4 Hit Dice or more, a Save vs. Spell is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under the character's control for 2 turns or until they are affected by a Dispel Magic.

This ability can be used at will.~
@22062=~Summon Lesser Bear
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls a single lesser bear to aid <PRO_HIMHER>. The bear is selected from the following:

Black Bear (is immune to acid and retaliates with an acid projectile when hit)
Brown Bear (is immune to electricity and retaliates with a lightning bolt when hit)

This innate version of Summon Lesser Bear allows the caster to choose which bear is summoned.~
@22069=~Phantasmal Killer

Casting Time: 5

One of the few offensive illusion spells, Phantasmal Killer causes the target to be struck down by an embodiment of its worst fears. If the target was panicking when it got hit by the spell, it must Save vs. Death at -4 or die instantly. If it makes the save or it wasn't panicking, it takes 2d6+3 magic damage.~
@22070=~Eldoth's Wyvern Call
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, Eldoth opens up a magical channel that will summon a wyvern to his aid. The creature will live and die at his command until the spell's duration expires.

Eldoth's version of the spell lasts shorter. The wyvern stays for just one round if Eldoth is level 1; for every additional level he has, the wyvern stays one round longer.~
@22082=~Mass Cure Wounds
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Healing
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the priest must picture the faces of <PRO_HISHER> fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group. Upon completion, all party members within a 15-ft. radius of the caster are healed 15 Hit Points. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal-or can be cured-just as any normal injury.~
@22087=~Aura of Flaming Death
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the caster to be enveloped by an aura of intense flame that both injures opponents and protects the caster from damage. This shield not only grants the user 90% Fire Resistance and an AC bonus of 4, but also protects <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius. An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 2d10+2 fire damage. In addition, the intense heat protects the caster from all non-magical weapons, melee or missile.~
@22088=~Spot Traps

Kivan can easily spot all traps in his vicinity, no matter how well hidden. However, this ability does not let him disarm them. He can use this ability at will.

This ability has no casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22089=~Alchemy

Actually, it's hardly alchemy; Alora makes the potions appear from nothing. Each time she uses this ability, she creates a potion, which is immediately consumed by the target of the ability. The potion can be selected from the following:

Potion of Regeneration
Potion of Stone Form
Potion of Absorption
Potion of Fire Resistance
Potion of Cold Resistance
Potion of Insulation
Antidote
Potion of Invisibility
Oil of Speed
Oil of Fiery Burning

Potion of Insight and Perception
Potion of Master Thievery

Potion of Life Protection~
@22090=~Shadow Twin

This ability creates an almost exact duplicate of the Shadowdancer for 2 turns. The duplicate is created at 60% of the level at which the Shadowdancer is currently on. It has all the abilities that the Shadowdancer would have at that level. It also has 60% of the Hit Points of the Shadowdancer. The duplicate is fully under the control of the Shadowdancer.~
@22091=~Shadow Maze

This ability opens a temporary gateway to a small pocket within the Plane of Shadow. All enemies within 10 feet of the Shadowdancer must make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or become trapped inside a shadowy labyrinth as per the Maze spell.~
@22092=~Shadow Form

This ability temporarily transposes some of the user's tissue with shadow-material, making the subject partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the Shadowdancer only deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the Shadowdancer is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.~
@22096=~Death Gaze

Casting Time: 0

Dorn's patron gave him this ability, which is similar to a nabassu's death gaze. Dorn glares at a creature, and that creature must Save vs. Death or be paralyzed. After 1 round, if the creature has not died yet, it is instantly slain, and it is turned into a ghast, which will be hostile.~
@22097=~Eldoth's Offensive Spin

During the next 4 rounds, Eldoth's movement rate triples and he gains a +5 bonus to hit and damage rolls as well as two extra attacks per round. All attacks deal maximum damage for the duration.

Eldoth's version of the ability can also be used alongside Haste and Improved Haste effects.~
@22098=~During the next 4 rounds, Garrick is rooted to the spot and becomes nigh-invulnerable. He gains +20 AC, +20 to all saving throws, and +99% resistance to all damage types except poison.~
@22101=~Quayle's Invisibility Gestures

Casting Time: 14

Through a long series of gestures, Quayle can make himself completely invisible. The invisibility lasts until 8 hours have passed or until he attacks or targets another creature. He can use this ability at will. Strangely, no one else becomes invisible when they replicate the gestures.~
@22106=~Lightning Storm
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2 

Lightning Storm is a spell only available to Shadow Druids. It calls a lightning bolt down upon every creature within 15 feet of the target point. These creatures take 2d8 electricity damage plus 1d8 per level, up to a maximum of 22d8 at level 20. Creatures can save vs. Spell for half damage. Unlike the 3rd level druid spell Call Lightning, this spell will not call down additional lightning bolts over time. Lightning Storm can only be cast outdoors.~
@22107=~Improved Haste

Casting Time: Instant

Montaron moves and attacks at twice his normal rate. Free Action does not prevent the effects of this ability. It lasts 2 rounds per level.

This ability has no casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22108=~Vanish

Casting Time: Instant

Montaron "vanishes," becoming invisible. He can attack and remain mostly invisible. Attacks against him suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and his Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. The invisibility lasts for four rounds at level 1, and it lasts another round for each additional level Montaron has.

This ability has no casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22109=~Back Poison

Casting Time: Instant

Montaron coats his weapon with a poison which, for the next 4 rounds, will be given to any creature whom he backstabs. The poison deals the same damage as the normal Poison Weapon ability (based on Montaron's level) and can stack with the damage from that ability.

This ability has no casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22110=~Assassination

Casting Time: Instant

Every strike in the next round acts as a backstab, using Montaron's current backstab modifier to determine damage.

This ability has no casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22111=~Phase

Casting Time: Instant

Montaron teleports to a random enemy he can see. If there are no enemies in sight, this ability does nothing. Montaron can use this ability while invisible without revealing his presence. He can use the ability at will. 

This ability has no casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22112=~Charm Person

Safana has an uncanny ability to get her enemies to serve her. This ability affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Breath to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails its Saving Throw vs. Breath, it regards Safana as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for five rounds. The party may give it orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If a party member harms-or attempts to harm-the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it is charmed. Safana's version of Charm Person does not count as a hostile action - when the charm ends, the creature will only turn hostile if it was hostile before it was charmed, or if it was attacked while it was charmed.

Safana can use this ability at will.~
@22113=~Mad Dash

For one round, Shar-Teel moves with amazing speed, four times her normal rate.~
@22115=~Intoxicate
(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The target of this spell will instantly become dangerously drunk, far more than is pleasurable. The target temporarily gains four points of intoxication, and for every point of Consitution less than 20 the target has, it gains an additional six points of intoxication and loses 1 point of Wisdom. Thus, if the target has a Constitution of 9, they will gain 70 points of intoxication and lose 10 points of Wisdom. Multiple castings of this spell will stack, and the Wisdom loss will kill the target if they have 0 Wisdom. Only Magic Resistance or a successful Save vs. Breath with a -8 penalty will negate this spell.

Note: High levels of intoxication give luck penalties. The size of the penalty depends on the number of intoxication points:

0-49:   No penalty
50-60: -2 Luck
60-69: -4 Luck
70-79: -6 Luck
80-89: -8 Luck
90-99: -10 Luck
100:   -12 Luck~
@22116=~Power Attack

The Power Attack ability allows the warrior to make more powerful attacks, but at the cost of accuracy. The warrior can choose to gain up to +5 damage as well as a THAC0 penalty of the same size. Power Attack can be used with ranged weapons. It cannot be dispelled.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22117=~Superior Magic Armor
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

A much more powerful version of the spell Armor, this spell creates a nigh-impenetrable barrier of force covering the caster. This barrier grants a base armor class of -10, far better than any suit of armor. The effects last for 2 turns or until dispelled.~
@22118=~Improved Power Attack

The Improved Power Attack ability allows the warrior to make more powerful attacks, but at the cost of accuracy. The warrior can choose to gain up to +9 damage as well as a THAC0 penalty of the same size. Improved Power Attack can be used with ranged weapons. It cannot be dispelled.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22121=~Protection From The Elements

Casting Time: 7

When the spell is cast, it confers 50% resistance to all elemental attacks-such as fire, cold, and electricity, whether magical or non magical-from spells, weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. For every two levels of the druid, it gives another 10% resistance, to a maximum of 100% at level 10. The effect of the druid's Protection From The Elements spell lasts 12 rounds or until dispelled.~
@22122=~Spiritual Clarity

Casting Time: 9

Totemic druids do not have nearly the power over spirits that true shamans have, but they do have some. With this spell, the druid strengthens a creature's spiritual resolve and purges the creature's mind of negative influences. The spell removes the effects of fear, charm, confusion, and feeblemind from a single creature.~
@22123=~Smite Evil

Casting Time: 1

This ability is one of the paladin's most iconic recourses against evil creatures. It only affects one creature and does absolutely nothing if the creature isn't evil. If it is, the ability brings a massive holy force down on the creature, dealing 5d6 nonlethal damage plus 1d6 per 2 levels, up to a maximum of 10d6 at level 10. There is no Saving Throw.~
@22125=~Expose to the Elements

Casting Time: 7

The reverse of Protection from the Elements, this ability increases the harm that extreme conditions do to the target's body. The ability targets a single creature. It lowers the creature's resistance to fire, cold and electric damage by 50%. For every two levels of the druid, the creature's resistance is lowered by an additional 10%, up to a maximum of 100% at level 10. The effects last for 12 rounds or until dispelled.~
@22128=~Assassination

Casting Time: 0

Using every clever trick that the thief has learned, this ability allows every strike in the next round to act as a backstab, using the thief's existing backstab modifier to determine damage.~
@22129=~Wizard Eye
(Divination, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this ability is employed, Coran creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye.~
@22141=~Improved Blur

Casting Time: 2

Similar to the spell Blur, this spell causes the appearance of the wizard to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all attacks against the caster to be made with a -4 penalty. The wizard also gains a +2 bonus to all of <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throws. Improved Blur lasts for 1 turn or until dispelled

What makes Improved Blur truly powerful is the fact that it is cumulative. When multiple Improved Blur spells are cast on the wizard, <PRO_HESHE> becomes more and more blurred, further increasing <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class and Saving Throws.~
@22147=~Protection From Magic Energy
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast, it confers 100% invulnerability to all magic-based attacks such as Magic Missile or Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@22151=~Power Word, Heal
(Conjuration/Summoning)
	
Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the Power Word of Healing is uttered, one creature of the caster's choice is instantly healed, regaining all Hit Points. The caster can cast Power Word, Heal on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane.~
@22156=~Fire Enhancement

Casting Time: 6

The Fire Enhancement ability amplifies the Sun Soul monk's fire prowess. For 1 turn, the monk gains 75% fire resistance, and all fire damage dealt by the monk is increased by 75%.~
@22160=~Improved Alacrity

Casting Time: 18

This ability allows the mage to ignore the normal limits of one spell cast per round. While under the effects of Improved Alacrity, they can begin casting a second spell immediately after the first. The effects of Improved Alacrity last five rounds.~
@22161=~Supreme Domination

Casting Time: 15

Similar to the 5th level mage spell Domination, this ability allows the enchanter to control the mind of a single creature for 2 turns. The target can make a Save vs. Spell with a -6 penalty to block the ability. As with the spell Domination, Supreme Domination gives the wizard access to the target's senses, allowing him or her to see what the target sees.~
@22162=~Extend Vision

Casting Time: 6

The spell Extend Vision allows the recipient to see much farther than <PRO_HESHE> could see before. The recipient will be able to see creatures that are too far away to return the gaze. More importantly, the recipient can target those creatures with spells and ranged attacks from far away. Extend Vision also makes the recipient immune to blindness. It lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled. Extend Vision can be cast on any creature the party sees, even if the caster cannot see them.~
@22163=~Meteor Swarm
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon completing the incantation for this spell, the wizard curses the target, destining them to be hit by a total of 12 small meteors over the next 5 rounds. Each one deals 1d6 crushing damage and 1d6 fire damage. In addition, each one knocks the target back. A successful Save vs. Wands negates the crushing damage, but the fire damage and the knockback are still dealt. The 12 meteors seek out the cursed target and will follow the target if it moves.~
@22164=~Mass Improved Haste

Casting Time: 3

An extremely powerful alteration spell with an unfortunately short duration, Mass Improved Haste doubles both the movement speed and attack rate of all allies within the area of effect. It lasts for 1 round per level, up to a maximum of 1 turn at level 10.~
@22165=~Spell Trap

Casting Time: 9

This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the abjurer. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap-making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if an abjurer shields <PRO_HIMHER>self with Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets three spell levels back; <PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 3rd level in power.

The spell trap lasts for 18 rounds and provides 30 levels of protection. The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~
@22166=~Glimpse of the Glabrezu

Casting Time: 3

The Glimpse of the Glabrezu spell briefly summons a horrible tanar'ri, a Greater Glabrezu, into the Prime Material Plane. This powerful demon will attack the nearest creature that isn't protected by Protection from Evil, but only for 2 rounds. After 2 rounds, the demon will be sent back to the Abyss. The demon summoned by this spell ignores the summoning limit.~
@22167=~Larloch's Major Drain 

Casting Time: 1

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 20 damage, while the Mage gains 20 Hit Points. If the Mage goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses any extra Hit Points after 3 turns.~
@22168=~Perfect Invisibility

Casting Time: 6

The Perfect Invisibility spell turns the caster invisible, and allows <PRO_HIMHER> to attack and cast spells and remain completely invisible. The spell lasts 3 rounds. Only effects which dispel illusions can reveal the caster before the spell ends.~
@22170=~Red Dragon Affinity

Casting Time: 6

This ability amplifies all fire damage dealt by the Red Dragon Disciple, whether from their breath weapon or from one of their spells. For 15 rounds, the Red Dragon Disciple deals 50% additional fire damage, plus an additional 5% per level, to a maximum of 100% at level 10.~
@22175=~Favored of the Spirits

Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful rite shields the Shaman from death for 1 hour or until discharged. While under the protection of this rite, the Shaman is immune to all forms of death magic. In addition, if the Shaman is reduced below 10% Hit Points and the rite is active, the Shaman instantly receives the benefit of a Heal spell. The rite's protection (including the immunity to death) is completely discharged once the Heal spell is triggered.~
@22176=~Ether Gate
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch 
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports one creature, chosen by the caster, to the Ethereal Plane. The creature vanishes for the spell's duration, at which point it returns to the physical world in the exact same spot where it was before. While in the Ethereal Plane, the victim cannot interact with anyone or anything that resides on the Prime Material Plane. There is no saving throw against this spell, though it is subject to magic resistance. Friendly creatures can lower their magic resistance so that the shaman can target them with this spell. In addition, Ether Gate is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against maze effects.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22190=~Great Shout

Casting Time: 1

The Great Shout ability causes the caster to produce a yell so loud as to be deadly. Releasing the shout is very taxing on the caster and will knock him or her unconscious for two rounds with no saving throw. However, the shout will do much worse things to the creatures in its path. The shout travels in a 15-degree cone, reaching a distance of about 36 feet away from the caster. Any creature of 5 HD or less that gets hit by the shout dies instantly with no saving throw; this form of instant death is so violent that a Death Ward will not protect against it. A stronger creature that gets hit will take 6d12 magic damage, become deafened permanently, become stunned for 2 rounds, and get knocked away from the caster. A successful Save vs. Spell will half the damage, reduce the duration of the deafness to 5 rounds, and reduce the duration of the stun to 1 round.~
@22199=~Translocation Trick

Casting Time: 0

This ability allows Alora to switch the positions of two creatures. There is no saving throw; the targets' Magic Resistance, if it has any, does not block this ability. Alora can use this spell on any characters in the party or on any creatures the party sees, even if Alora does not see them.

Alora can use this ability at will.~
@22204=~Detect Shapeshifters

Casting Time: 2

When the ferret uses this ability, all shapeshifters within 150 feet glow purple momentarily. In addition, the ferret learns what kind of shapeshifter each one is. It can send this information to its master.~
@22205=~Infernal Domination

Casting Time: 5

Infernal Domination is an innate ability possessed by all baatezu, with the exception of lemures. It is similar to the 5th level wizard spell Domination, except that it can only affect creatures that are weaker (fewer Hit Dice) than the caster. Unless the target makes a Save vs. Spell at -2, its mind is completely enslaved by the caster. The caster also has access to the creature's thoughts and senses, allowing it to see what the creature sees. Your imp familiar counts as a 5 HD creature, and thus it can dominate creatures of 4 HD or less. You, as its master, are immune to the ability regardless of your level. Devils usually use Infernal Domination to control other devils. Imps in particular use the ability on lemures and nupperibos, the only devils they outrank.~
@22207=~Blood Rage

Casting Time: 5


The target of this ability will become afflicted with Blood Rage for 5 rounds unless it makes a successful Save vs. Spell.

Blood Rage is an even more savage form of berserk in which the character immediately attacks the nearest creature even if they weren't previously in combat. It is preferable to use this ability on enemies rather than allies, in the hopes of making enemies attack each other.~
@22211=~Extraordinary Luck

Casting Time: 2

"Extraordinary" is definitely an understatement of the sheer amount of good fortune this ability gives the thief. During the duration of the ability, it is almost possible to *see* the way reality is warped as it accommodates the newfound luck of the individual.

For 4 rounds, the thief gains 20 points of luck, a +20 bonus to all saving throws, a +20 AC bonus, and a +100% bonus to all thieving skills. These effects cannot be dispelled.~
@22216=~Chain Lightning 
(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: 1/2 

When Garrick casts Chain Lightning, arcs of electrical energy burst from his fingertips. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies near the caster, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels of the caster. If the target of the lightning saves vs. Spell, only half damage is inflicted. Thus, a 12th-level wizard will cause 6d6 damage to a victim (3d6 if the victim makes <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw vs. Spell). Garrick's version of the spell considers him to be 10 levels higher than normal.~
@22219=~Mass Charm
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30 ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects all hostile people in the area of effect. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The people are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipients fail their Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), they regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give them orders, and the charmed individuals will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms-or attempts to harm-the charmed people by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon them, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subjects have full memory of the events that took place while they were charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it is charmed.~

Opponents under the influence of this spell make all Saving Throws at a penalty of -4. Multiple Greater Malison spells stack, giving the recipients additional saving throw penalties.

@22224=~Dimension Door
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports the caster to any place within the visual range of the caster. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, who immediately steps through it. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds <PRO_HIMHER>self at <PRO_HISHER> chosen destination.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22225=~Dispel Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Dispel Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22226=~Conjure Lesser Kobold
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: 8 rounds

@22227=~Enervate
(Necromancy) 

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane. The target must make a successful Save vs. Polymorph at -10. If it fails the save, it is temporarily drained of one level. It regains the level after 8 hours. The target's Magic Resistance, if it has any, does not prevent the effects of this spell.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22228=~Spook
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical, which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.

This character can cast this spell at will.~

@22235=~Longspear

The spear is a +3 weapon which gets +3 to hit and deals 1d6+3 piercing damage (plus Strength and proficiency bonuses). It can be used as a backstab weapon. Any creature hit by the spear is instantly pulled to the wielder of the spear, with no saving throw. The spear vanishes after 12 rounds. For the duration, if the character has no proficiency in wielding spears, <PRO_HESHE> becomes proficient in spears.~

Level: 4
Range: Line of sight of caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a moose unless a Save vs. Petrification/Polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until a Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~

A spellcaster can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger may not be given to other characters. Once the spell trigger is used, the icon will disappear from the Special Ability button.

Sequencer Touch is unique among sequencers in that it requires the caster to touch the creature <PRO_HESHE> wants to unleash the spells on. The caster does not need to make a successful melee attack against the target to activate the spells, but <PRO_HESHE> needs to be right next to the target. Spells which require the caster to make a successful melee attack will not work with Sequencer Touch.

The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spells that were chosen will be cast automatically.

A limitation of this spell is that the target of the spells placed in the contingency must be the caster: Therefore, they may not be offensive spells, nor may they target any other party members.

(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts this powerful spell, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground under every ally within 15 feet, completely covering them. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the characters in no way. The effect of this is to protect each of them from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would grant 5 skins. For each skin a character possesses, the spell will stop one attack. The skins will remain on the characters until they are affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect characters from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.~

@22279=~Bounce Spell
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This simple abjuration should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. If the wizard would be hit by a spell within 2 rounds of casting, <PRO_HESHE> will be unaffected, and the incoming spell will be reflected back at its caster. Bounce Spell expires if it reflects a spell, or after 2 rounds have passed.

This spell reflects spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22280=~Absorb Spell
(Abjuration)

Level: 5

Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

This simple but powerful spell should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. It blocks the first spell (of any level) that hits the caster within the next 2 rounds. If a spell is blocked this way, the wizard absorbs its power, regaining a previously cast spell whose level is less than or equal to the level of the spell absorbed. For example, if the wizard is hit by a Finger of Death (7th-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets seven spell levels back-<PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 7th level in power.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).

By invoking this spell, the caster switches <PRO_HISHER> own life force with that of the recipient, exchanging all physical injuries. The spell will only function if the caster has more Hit Points than the target before the switch is attempted. This switch is permanent until the caster uses normal methods to heal the damage. Only the Hit Points are exchanged; the caster cannot take on other conditions from the target such as disease, poison, intoxication, and similar afflictions.

This spell cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters. It has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.

Sirene can cast this spell at will.~
@22282=~Short Rest

Drake has the ability to get a night's sleep very quickly, even faster than an elf can. Upon using this ability, he goes to sleep for 3 rounds. During those 3 rounds, he cannot defend himself, and if he takes damage or he is hit by an attack or spell, he wakes up and gets no benefit from the rest. If he rests for the full 3 rounds, he wakes up with his fatigue gone and all of his spells restored. He does not regain Hit Points by resting in this way, though.

Drake can use this ability at will.~
@22283=~Single Stoneskin

Casting Time: Special

White can create a single skin of stone around himself, which blocks the next physical attack that would hit him. The time it takes him to use this ability decreases as he grows more experienced.

White can use this ability at will.~

@22285=~Ruby Ray Of Reversal
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The magical ray produced by this spell will invert the target's resistance to all damage types except for poison and magic damage. Thus, if the spell were to be cast on a fire elemental with 100% fire resistance and 50% weakness to cold, it would then have 50% cold resistance and 100% weakness to fire. This spell only affects innate resistances; resistances from items and other spells do not get reversed. Ruby Ray of Reversal has no effect on golems and other creatures with immutable form.~
@22286=~Beast Sense
(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

The Beast Sense spell allows the character to see through the eyes of an animal and sense what it senses. For the duration of the spell or until dispelled, the party can see any creature or object that the animal can see. Beast Sense does not by itself allow the character to control the animal, though it could be cast on a charmed animal for use as a scout. The spell has no effect on a creature that isn't an animal.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22287=~Arrow of the Solar

Casting Time: 6

Using this ability, the archer paladin creates a single arrow of massive divine power, similar to the arrows of a solar. When fired, the arrow becomes a divine bolt that passes through creatures, damaging every creature in its path. The arrow counts as +6 and deals 4d6+6 piercing damage (plus any other damage bonuses), with +100 to hit. It uses the longbow proficiency, though it gets no penalties if the archer paladin has no proficiency in longbows. In addition, any evil creature with 60 hit points or fewer that is hit by the arrow must Save vs. Death at -4 or die instantly. If the archer paladin is using Called Shot, the arrow will apply the effects of Called Shot to every creature it hits. If not fired, the arrow disappears after 1 hour.~
@22288=~Champion's Aim
(Alteration)

Level: 5 
Sphere: Law
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

By casting this spell, the priest draws on the power of <PRO_HISHER> god to empower a single creature, effectively creating a champion. For the duration, the recipient's aim with missile weapons improves to godlike heights, gaining +10 to hit with missile weapons and scoring a critical hit on any roll from 10 to 20 with missile weapons.

The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and <PRO_HISHER> god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells or innate abilities during this time. The effect lasts for 15 rounds or until dispelled.~
@22289=~Cause Minor Wounds

Casting Time: 1

This spell is the reverse of Cure Minor Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. When cast upon a creature, the creature takes 5 magic damage. The caster does not need to make an attack roll to hit the target.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22290=~Destruction
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell instantly destroys a target, blasting it into small chunks. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Death at a penalty of -4; if successful, the target takes 8d6 points of magic damage instead of being destroyed. Unlike the similar 5th-level spell Slay Living, Destruction destroys the target with divine force rather than with negative energy; therefore, it can affect undead, constructs, and extraplanar creatures.~
@22291=~Summon

Casting Time: 0

The ability Summon allows Tiax to pull another creature to him. For two rounds, the target creature will constantly be pulled to Tiax. If Tiax moves, the creature will be dragged along with him. This ability has extremely long range, and Tiax can use this ability even if he cannot see the target.

Tiax can use this ability at will.~
@22292=~Dismiss

Casting Time: 0

The ability Dismiss allows Tiax to push another creature away from him. For two rounds, the target creature will constantly be pushed away from Tiax. This ability has extremely long range, and Tiax can use this ability even if he cannot see the target.

Tiax can use this ability at will.~
@22293=~Attain Perfection

Casting Time: 9

This ability temporarily makes the character perfect in every way. For 1 turn, the character's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all set to 25. The character can potentially use this time to equip items with high stat requirements.~
@22295=~Global Domination

Casting Time: 40

Global Domination, Tiax's ultimate ability, allows him to take control of every creature in the entire plane for five rounds. There is no Saving Throw, and even undead and constructs are affected; only Magic Resistance can prevent the effects of this ability. The creatures themselves do not realize that they are being controlled by Tiax, and creatures outside the current area will go about their lives as normal unless they are specifically given commands by Tiax. Tiax can also see through the eyes of multiple creatures dominated this way, though there is a maximum number of independent sets of senses he can process at once. Global Domination is not a hostile act; creatures will not be hostile after the effect ends unless they were initially hostile or they were attacked during the effect.~
@22297=~Guardian Eyes

Casting Time: 0

As a paladin of Helm, Ajantis has the power to turn other people into guards, regardless of their willingness. After using this ability on a humanoid, Ajantis is able to see through that person's eyes and see what he or she sees for 2 hours. This ability can be cast even on hostile humanoids who are unwilling to assist Ajantis in any way, though this ability alone does not allow Ajantis to control the target. Guardian Eyes is not a hostile act; it will not turn neutral creatures hostile. There is no Saving Throw, and Magic Resistance cannot stop this ability. The range of this ability is not limited by Ajantis' visual range. Guardian Eyes can only affect humanoids and giant humanoids.

Ajantis can use this ability at will.~
@22300=~Expertise

The Expertise ability allows the character to fight defensively at the cost of accuracy. The character can choose to gain up to +5 AC as well as a THAC0 penalty of the same size. Expertise cannot be dispelled.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22301=~Improved Expertise

The Improved Expertise ability allows the character to fight defensively at the cost of accuracy. The character can choose to gain up to +9 AC as well as a THAC0 penalty of the same size. Improved Expertise cannot be dispelled.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22302=~Critical Boon

Casting Time: 0

This ability allows the character to bestow the effects of Critical Strike upon a creature of <PRO_HISHER> choice. For 1 round, every attack the target makes is an automatic critical hit, regardless of the roll.~
@22303=~Secret Swap

Casting Time: 0

The character instantly switches places with another creature. The character can use this even if the target is on the other side of the area (though they must be in the same area), or if the target is hidden or invisible.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22304=~Darts of Bone
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect. The darts are +3, do 1d4+3 missile damage with +3 to hit, and a creature struck by a dart must Save vs. Death at -6 or take 2d6 magic damage and have its Strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds. Strength reduction is cumulative, and hitting a single creature with multiple darts can potentially reduce its Strength to 0, killing it instantly. Undead, constructs and extraplanar creatures are immune to the magic damage and Strength reduction from these darts. The caster gains proficiency in darts as long as <PRO_HESHE> has at least one dart remaining, unless <PRO_HESHE> already has a higher level of proficiency in darts.

This character can cast this spell at will.~
@22306=~Red Metamagic

Casting Time: 0

By using Red Metamagic, the Red Soul can amplify the damage of <PRO_HISHER> spells even further, but at great danger. As long as this ability is active, any non-physical damage dealt by the Red Soul is increased by 100% rather than by 50%. However, the Red Soul also becomes extremely vulnerable to all damage and cannot gain any damage resistances while this ability is active. Once used, Red Metamagic can be disabled at any time as a free action.

The Red Soul can use this ability at will.~
@22307=~Green Metamagic

Casting Time: 0

While using Green Metamagic, non-physical damage dealt by the Green Soul is not halved, but it has the opposite effect, healing instead of dealing damage. For example, an Agannazar's Scorcher spell, rather than dealing a total of 3d6 damage, will heal the targets by a total of 6d6 hit points. Once used, Green Metamagic can be disabled at any time as a free action.

The Green Soul can use this ability at will.~
@22309=~Perfect Clone

Casting Time: Instant

Using this ability, Glint creates a copy of himself that is almost completely identical to him. The clone is at the same level as Glint and has all of Glint's spells and abilities except for Perfect Clone. The clone is not an illusion but rather a flesh-and-blood perfect duplicate of Glint. For 8 hours, the clone will serve the party with the utmost loyalty.

The ability has not casting time, can be used immediately after another ability, and can be used while the game is paused.~
@22310=~Glint's Irresistible Spin

Casting Time: 0

Upon using this ability, Glint forces a creature to spin in place for 8 hours. The creature will do nothing other than repeatedly spin in place, even if it sees enemies. There is no Saving Throw, and the creature's Magic Resistance makes no difference. If the creature takes damage, the effect will end. Whether or not the effect ends early, the creature cannot be affected by Glint's Irresistible Spin for 8 hours from the time the ability was used. This ability has extremely long range, and Glint can use this ability even if he cannot see the target.

Glint can use this ability at will.~
@22311=~Black Blade of Disaster
(Evocation) 

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift about three feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster is considered to be proficient to the point of Grand Mastery in this weapon. The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Also, every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~
@22312=~Xzar's Vampiric Touch

Casting Time: 3

When this spell is cast, the target loses 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for a 12th-level caster. These Hit Points are added to Xzar's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over Xzar's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 hour. If Xzar casts his signiture Vampiric Touch multiple times, the temporary Hit Points will stack.

Xzar can use this ability at will.~
@22329=~Wave Blessing

Casting Time: 0

By using Wave Blessing, Tenya empowers the target's next critical hit. The next time the blessed creature makes a successful critical hit, it instantly casts Smashing Wave on the creature it hit. After that happens, or after 7 rounds have passed, the effect ends. If the critical hit is averted, the wave will not be released, but the effect will not end yet.~
@22330=~Smite Boon

Casting Time: 0

This ability allows the character to bestow the effects of Smite upon a creature of <PRO_HISHER> choice. For 1 round, every attack the target makes is an automatic critical hit, regardless of the roll. In addition, for 2 rounds, every attack the target makes will cause knockback and stun for 1 round (a successful Save vs. Paralysis negates the stun but not the knockback).~
@22332=~Kill

Casting Time: 0

By using this ability, Vynd instantly kills a single creature that has 60 Hit Points or less. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. Kill can be cast instantly and requires no words or gestures to use.

Vynd regains this ability 3 rounds after using it.~
@22333=~Globe of Blades

Casting Time: 3

This ability creates of globe of whirling blades surrounding the character. Every 2 seconds, each creature within 4 feet of the character takes 1d6 slashing damage with no Saving Throw. The character can end the effects of Globe of Blades at any time. Otherwise, the globe lasts permanently and cannot be dispelled.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22337=~Greater Shield of Lathander
(Conjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the recipient 100% Magic Resistance and immunity to damage for the duration of the spell. Evil creatures cannot be protected by a Greater Shield of Lathander. This spell can only be cast by good-aligned characters.

@22339=~Stinking Cloud
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When casting Stinking Cloud, Korax creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 90 ft. away from its position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Poison at +2 or be sent reeling and fall down for 1d2 rounds. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A Dispel Magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud, then they are still subject to its effects.

Korax can cast Stinking Cloud at will.~
@22340=~Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 24 hours
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes Korax to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, Korax is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render it detectable. Items dropped or put down by Korax become visible. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until Korax attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed.

Korax can cast Invisibility at will.~
@22342=~Superflail

Casting Time: 3

By using this ability, Will gives a creature a Superflail, which replaces the creature's previous weapon for 15 rounds. The Superflail is a +12 flail, which attacks for 1d12+12 damage and gets +12 to hit. It gives the wielder proficiency in flails if <PRO_HESHE> is not already proficient.~
@22343=~Supercrush

Casting Time: 0

By using this ability, Will causes a creature to experience a crushing blow of immense power from an invisible force. The creature takes exactly 60 crushing damage. There is no Saving Throw, Magic Resistance cannot prevent it, and the damage bypasses the creature's Crushing Resistance.~
@22347=~Hop

Casting Time: 0

Alora instantly teleports to any location within 10000 feet that the party is aware of.

Alora can use this ability at will.~
@22353=~Greater Wizard Eye
(Divination)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

A much more potent version of Wizard Eye, this spell creates an invisible, ethereal eye. The caster can see anything the eye sees. The eye can see invisible or ethereal creatures, and its visual range is increased significantly. It can also move through walls: simply click on a point anywhere on the map, and the eye will float to that point, passing through normally impassable obstacles in the way.~
@22358=~Mimic Spell

Casting Time: 0

Imoen has the ability to copy a spellcaster's incantations and gestures perfectly, regardless of whether she understands them. In mimicking a spell, she chooses two creatures, one of which must be casting a spell. She then casts a copy of that spell on the other creature. If both creatures are casting spells, Imoen mimics the second creature's spell and casts it on the first creature. She can use this ability either to double an ally's spell or to give an enemy spellcaster a taste of their own medicine.

Imoen can use this ability at will.~
@22370=~Elemental Weapons

This ability lets the character imbue their weapons with a particular kind of element or energy: fire, cold, electricity, acid, or magic. While the ability is active, the base damage type of the character's weapons is changed to the chosen damage type. For example, a sword could be altered to deal fire damage rather than slashing damage. Altered weapons will still gain damage bonuses from Strength or abilities (if any); the bonus damage will also be of the new damage type. This ability lasts until it is turned off by using it again and selecting the option to turn it off.

This character can use this ability at will.~
@22378=~Shapeshift: Ankheg

@24000=~The spell reveals no information about the target.~
@24001=~Cows are very heavy but are great at jumping! Once per round, a cow can jump very high and land on a creature, dealing 4d6 crushing damage with a Save vs. Breath for half.~
@24002=~Hulrik's cow is very large and fat, even for a cow. She's probably too heavy to jump as other cows can, but she can take much more punishment. For some reason, she is able to move during Time Stop, even if someone else casts it.~
@24003=~As a paladin of Helm, Ajantis can see invisible creatures and cannot be backstabbed. He has some very useful innate abilities and mastery in several weapons.~
@24004=~Alora is extremely good at all thieving skills, partly due to her amazing luck and partly due to her Dexterity. She has Aura Cleansing and can teleport anywhere on the map and switch places with any creature.~
@24005=~Baeloth is a powerful sorcerer with many innate abilities, and since he is a Drow, he has 50% magic resistance. He can cast 3 additional spells of each spell level,  His special ring gives him Aura Cleansing and lets him cast his spells instantly, but it also causes his spells to target the wrong creature.~
@24006=~Branwen is a priestess whose divine spells are greatly enhanced. Branwen is considered to be 6 levels higher for purposes of determining the power of her divine spells.~
@24007=~Coran is one of the few fighter/bounty hunters. He has permanent Free Action, immunity to wing buffet and pulling effects, a +70% Set Traps bonus, and a +50 bonus to Saves vs. Polymorph.

He knows every mage spell of 1st and second level, and he has a special 3rd level spell called Garrick's Flame Arrow.~
@24014=~Imoen can attack 5 times per round no matter what weapon she's using. She is immune to acid, and acid damage will actually heal her. Her Phantom Blade allows her to attack and backstab at long range.~

He gains +1 to all saving throws for every 20000 gold the party currently has, to a maximum of +10 to all saves at 200000 gold or more.~
@24017=~Khalid is a Harper. He has grandmastery in all weapons, though he cannot obtain any proficiency in fighting styles. He can cast spells while wearing heavy armor, and he is immune to any effect that would disable his spellcasting, such as Silence or Miscast Magic. He is permanently hasted (this haste is not negated by Free Action) and can do things while time is stopped regardless of who stopped it. He has great Saves vs. Breath but terrible Saves vs. Death.~
@24018=~Kivan gets +6 to hit with missile weapons (this stacks with the bonuses from the archer kit), and his critical hit chance with missile weapons is increased by 30%. He can see farther than normal, allowing him to attack enemies before they can see him. He gets +20 to hit against half-ogres. He is great at finding traps.~
@24019=~Minsc deals maximum damage with each hit and attacks with zero Speed Factor regardless of his weapon. He has +50 to Saves vs. Death and his maximum hit points are increased by 40.~

@24021=~Neera has Aura Cleansing, and she counts as 11 levels higher for purposes of determining the power of her spells. However, every spell she casts triggers a wild surge. Neera is highly resistant against some damage types and very weak against others. She can cast Ruby Ray of Reversal on herself to turn her weaknesses into resistances and vice versa.~
@24022=~Quayle is the greatest of geniuses, and he knows almost every non-necromancy mage spell of 4th level or lower. He can turn himself invisible at will and can target partially invisible creatures with spells.~

He is specialized in all weapons a cleric can use. He never gets tired, even after casting Greater Restoration.~
@24032=~The tutors are harmless, though they are always teleporting around randomly. Since putting on clothes while teleporting around is really difficult, the tutors wear a single set of clothes their whole life. Don't worry, it's not as bad as it sounds, because the tutors DO wash and clean their clothes; they just do it while they're wearing them. They need to bathe in a very large bathtub to avoid accidentally teleporting out of the tub. That problem might be avoided if they bathed in a much large body of water like a river, but alas, there are no rivers in Candlekeep. Although there is certainly a large body of water outside of Candlekeep, the problem is that if the tutors left Candlekeep they would have to present a tome of great value to the Keeper of the Portal to get back in. Most of the tutors can't do that, because they gave their only acceptable tome the first time they entered Candlekeep. Now you might be thinking, why don't they just stand at the walls and have their random teleportation teleport them through? There are two problems with that idea, unfortunately. One is that the walls are too thick to teleport through with the short distance that they teleport with that ability. The other is that the walls of Candlekeep are enhanced by special wards that prevent people from teleporting through them. The tutors will have to contend with bathing in bathtubs and occasionally teleporting out of them and getting the floor wet.~
@24033=~Firebead Elvenhair knows two spells, Flame Arrow and Flesh to Stone. He is a nice person, and if he sees you under attack by an evildoer, he might help you out. Also, if you talk to him 30 times, he will give you 300 gold.~
@24034=~Gantolandan is asleep. He will probably wake up if you attack him. Whenever Gantolandan gets hit by an attack or spell, he summons an efreeti. The efreeti is under his control.~
@24035=~Whenever Gantolandan gets hit by an attack or spell, he summons an efreeti. The efreeti is under his control. Gantolandan's efreet help him in his thieving endeavors.~
@24036=~Garan is a terribly thuggish mage who casts Imprisonment on people who anger him. He tends to carry around at least one scroll of Freedom at any given time. Like most ankheg trainers, he has 120% resistance to acid.~
@24037=~Gellana Mirrorshade has two spells: Champion's Strength and Cause Critical Wounds. If she sees a warrior in your party fighting an evildoer, she might cast Champion's Strength on him or her.~
@24038=~Gibberlings move very fast, have great THAC0, and attack six times per round. However, they don't have many Hit Points, they are extremely easy to hit, and they have terrible saving throws. They also take double damage from fire. Even as simple a tool as a torch could kill a gibberling.~
@24039=~Diseased Gibberlings are some of the weakest monsters around, almost as weak as Lesser Kobolds. It would be embarrassing for an adventurer to get killed by one of these. Like all gibberlings, they take double damage from fire.~
@24040=~Garclax's Minor Globe of Invulnerability protects him against a lot of spells. However, if you can overcome the globe, he has the same terrible saving throws every gnoll has.~
@24041=~Whenever Ludrug takes damage, he teleports to the source of the damage, and he dispels all dispellable effects on himself. If he were smarter he would have realized that he could intentionally injure himself to dispel harmful effects on himself while out of combat. Or perhaps he knows that and just doesn't want to. Ludrug also has the same terrible saving throws that every gnoll has.~
@24042=~Gnoll Elites have 50% resistance to all physical damage, so it is even less of a good idea to fight them in melee than it is with other gnolls. However, they are also even more vulnerable to magic than other gnolls are. Not only do they have the same terrible saving throws as all gnolls, they are also 100% weak to fire, cold, electricity, acid and magic damage.~
@24043=~A Gnoll Chieftain can cast a single Web spell, which it uses to assert authority over other gnolls, whose terrible saving throws prevent them from escaping the web. The chieftain itself is normally immune to the web due to its Minor Globe of Invulnerability. If the chieftain's protection were to be removed, it could get stuck in its own web.~
@24044=~Gnoll Slashers automatically get a critical hit on each attack. However, they actually have fewer Hit Points than normal gnolls.~
@24045=~Gnoll Veterans have 99% Missile Resistance and many Hit Points. They can cast the Power Word, Stun spell, though they don't have the wisdom to use it effectively. They will cast it on the first enemy they see, even if that creature has more than 90 current Hit Points.~
@24046=~Gnolls are savage fighters, dealing 3 very accurate, damaging attacks per round. However, their saving throws are terrible.~
@24047=~Flinds are immune to fire, and they have an ability that deals fire damage to a creature and pulls them to it. Like all gnolls, they have terrible saving throws.~
@24048=~Britik is one of the scarier gnolls. His halberd deals bonus damage against panicking creatures. However, he does have a gnoll's standard terrible saving throws.~
@24049=~Ingot has 100% resistance to missile and magic damage, but is 50% weak to fire, cold, electricity and acid. He is a dangerous fighter with a very powerful halberd.~
@24050=~This is a rakshasa pretending to be Irlentree. The real name of this creature is Juskal.~
@24051=~This is a rakshasa pretending to be Zorl. The real name of this creature is Shalak.~
@24052=~Zordral is an aspiring acid-mage. In battle, he lowers his foe's acid resistance before casting his signiture spell Zordral's Corrosive Breath.~
@24053=~All zombies drain their victims' Intelligence on hit. In addition, any creature that hits them gets pulled to them.~
@24054=~Zal is the fastest dart thrower on the Sword Coast, capable of throwing 10 darts per round. He is a member of the Blacktalons and as such he gets +20 to hit with ranged weapons. Zal in particular relies so much on his darts that he will throw them at point blank instead of switching to a melee weapon.~
@24055=~Whenever an xvart moves, it stops time for 2 seconds. It regains this ability after 4 seconds. When fighting an xvart, it is wise to face it in melee combat, since it will not stop time if it is standing in place and attacking. An xvart attacks 5 times per round and can move and attack while time is stopped, regardless of who stopped it.~
@24056=~Arral the Shade Master summons a Lesser Death Shade whenever he gets hit. Also, whenever he gets hit, he casts Mass Invisibility. This will turn his Lesser Death Shades invisible.~
@24057=~Alenis Xvartfoot stops time whenever he moves, just like an xvart does. Alenis stops time for a longer period of 1 round, and he regains the ability after 1 round.~
@24058=~Sorar can attack in a Cone of Cold with his Huge Flail of Frost. He cannot do any damage to a creature that's immune to cold. He himself is immune to both cold and magic cold, though he is 50% weak to electricity.~
@24059=~Glansh is a fighter/mage, and here is his strategy. At the beginning of combat, he puts on Stoneskin and Minor Globe of Invulnerability. The first spell he casts is Blood Rage. The second spell he casts is Shadow Door, which turns him invisible, most likely causing the berserk creature to attack one of their allies. While invisible, he will cast Improved Alacrity, then he will cast five Lightning Bolt spells in a row. He will then cast Improved Haste and Tenser's Transformation, and he will attack.~
@24060=~Kolik has 99% resistance to all damage types. If he takes damage, he summons an Invisible Stalker. Even still, Kolik dreads taking damage, because he doesn't have many Hit Points. His wail can cause people to die.~
@24061=~The fists of Ustier the Plated Monk will trigger the effects of Bigby's Clenched Fist.~
@24062=~If you are reading this, you shouldn't have much trouble killing Finim, if that's what you want to do.~
@24063=~Rannick Demonfinger can summon Greater Glabrezus at will, though he has no way of protecting himself against them. Although he can certainly put up a fight, he is afraid to fight most of the time because he's worried he could get killed by his demons.~
@24064=~Rassul the Detonater likes to blow his enemies up with his arrows. He tends to carry one Arrow of Detonation and one Blue Arrow of Detonation with him at all times. He is immune to fire and cold. He always uses his bow, even at point blank.~
@24065=~Sargern is a priest of Cyric. In battle, first he casts Greater Command twice. Then he casts Hold Person once. Then he casts Cause Serious Wounds twice. Finally he casts Animate Dead four times. If he is below 50% of his health, he casts Cure Serious Wounds, which he can do twice. Whenever he casts a spell, he automatically casts Animate Dead. He can automatically see and target invisible creatures.~
@24066=~Orach is very hard to hit, as he has an Armor Class of -26. He can use Enrage, but only once. After that wears off, he is vulnerable to mind-affecting spells.~
@24067=~Neth Sederavan is a fighter with some spellcasting abilities. First he casts Damage Turning. Then he casts Globe of Invulnerability. Finally he casts Imprisonment on one of his enemies. If he is in combat but he doesn't see an enemy or none of his enemies are close enough to him, he teleports to one before casting Imprisonment. Then he attacks.~
@24068=~Whenever Jalos hits someone with an attack, they get stunned for 3 seconds with no saving throw. He would make a powerful ally if you charmed him!~
@24069=~A Blacktalon Elite is an expert archer whose arrows almost never miss. Like all Blacktalons, the elites get +20 THAC0 with ranged weapons. A Blacktalon Elite will switch to melee weapons (which are much less dangerous) if an enemy gets too close.~
@24070=~This basic Iron Throne mercenary is a skilled fighter with poor saving throws.~
@24071=~This elite Iron Throne mercenary is a very skilled fighter with mediocre saving throws.~
@24072=~This guard tries to rush his enemies and attack too quickly to handle, but he doesn't have many Hit Points.~
@24073=~This guard is an excellent archer (though not as excellent as a member of the Blacktalons) who can attack 5 times per round. If you get up close to him, he switches to a melee weapon but not before using War Cry.~
@24074=~This is a member of the Blacktalons who decided to work directly for the Iron Throne. He starts with two skins of Stoneskin on, deals high damage, gets +20 THAC0 with missile weapons, and has protection from Time Stop. He can use Greater Whirlwind Attack but only once; if you run away until it wear off, he won't be able to use it again. Barring extraordinary circumstances, he only has 19 Hit Points, making him a prime target for Power Word, Sleep.~
@24075=~Gorion is a powerful mage who has never met his match. He is immune to knockback effects such as wing buffet; this really helped him when he and his colleagues fought a rampaging red dragon. They defeated the dragon, though it managed to escape before they could kill it.~
@24076=~This is not Gorpel Hind; this is a greater doppelganger!~
@24077=~This is not Farluck; this is a doppelganger!~

@24101=~The Bothersome Sentries are constructs in Durlag's Tower that get imprisoned when they take damage.~
@24102=~A Lesser Death Shade has 1 HP and an Armor Class of 20. It has -28 THAC0 and when it hits a creature it deals 50% of its maximum HP rounded down.~
@24103=~Phlydia is a very forgetful mage, but luckily she still remembers some of her spells. The spells she has are Ray of Enfeeblement, Melf's Acid Arrow, and Magic Missile, and she casts them in that order. She is a nice person and is willing to cast spells on your behalf if she sees an evildoer attacking you.~
@24104=~This is Anoobergaran, a juvenile brass dragon. Currently he is shapeshifted as a human, but he will reveal his true form if attacked. Although his talkativeness can be irritating at times, he is a creature of good, and the world will not look highly upon you if you kill him.~
@24105=~Anoobergaran has a very large number of Hit Points, an extremely high Armor Class, impenetrable Saving Throws, 50% Fire Resistance, and 20% Magic Resistance. He can see invisible creatures. When he is reduced below 25% HP, he can cast Heal, but only once. He can use his aura of fear once per turn, his wing buffet once per three rounds, and his breath weapon once per six rounds.~
@24106=~This is not Golin Vend; this is a greater doppelganger!~
@24107=~Genthore is a durable fighter who can cast Critical Strike once per day. He likes to wield axes that are especially deadly on a critical hit, such as the Beruel's Retort throwing axes, which can disintegrate foes on a critical hit. If you run away when he uses his Critical Strike and return once it wears off, he will become much less dangerous.~
@24108=~No wonder this cat wasn't killing the rats.~
@24109=~A Doom Guard fires 10 arrows per round, and it has a virtually infinite supply of them. It is immune to fire, cold, electricity, acid, poison, magic fire, magic cold, and magic damage. It has 99% resistance to all physical damage, so most physical attacks will deal 1 damage. Barring extraordinary circumstances, a Doom Guard has only 3 hit points. It is unaffected by the Legacy of Bhaal. It can move during Time Stop regardless of who stopped time. A Doom Guard is a kind of golem, and as such it is immutable. This means that its resistances cannot be changed, it has +50 to Saves vs. Polymorph, and it is immune to disintegration and polymorph effects. Legend has it that there is a special hammer somewhere in the world that can remove the immutability of golems.~
@24110=~A Battle Horror is immune to missiles, poison, and magic damage. It has 99% resistance to all other damage, so most attacks will deal 1 damage. Barring extraordinary circumstances, a Battle Horror has only 7 hit points. It is unaffected by the Legacy of Bhaal.

Barring extraordinary circumstances, a Helmed Horror has only 7 hit points. It is unaffected by the Legacy of Bhaal. A Helmed Horror's morningstar gives a cumulative -4 penalty to Save vs. Polymorph with each hit, and it will cast Disintegrate on a creature that has worse than 15 Save vs. Polymorph.

This means that its resistances cannot be changed, it has +50 to Saves vs. Polymorph, and it is immune to disintegration and polymorph effects. Legend has it that there is a special hammer somewhere in the world that can remove the immutability of golems.~
@24112=~Hobgoblins get +20 to hit, but only with melee attacks (including melee weapons with long reach, such as Phantom Blade and Spiritual Hammer). Spellcasting hobgoblins count as twenty levels higher for purposes of determining spell power.~
@24113=~Hobgoblin Elites, like all hobgoblins, get +20 to hit with melee weapons and +20 caster level with all spells. Hobgoblin Elites in particular can cast Bless, but they know no other spells.~
@24114=~Chill Hobgoblins, like all hobgoblins, get +20 to hit with melee weapons and +20 caster level with all spells. Chill Hobgoblins in particular can cast Melf's Acid Arrow but nothing else. Chill Hobgoblins have a tendency to go invisible but they have no idea why.~
@24115=~Hulrik can move during Time Stop, regardless of who uses it. This has saved his life from marauding xvarts on multiple occassions. His cows, on the other hand, haven't been so lucky. Some of them are also unaffected by Time Stop, but they cannot run away fast enough.~
@24116=~Hurgan Stoneblade is a level 25 dwarf warrior, almost the peer of Durlag Trollkiller but not quite. He has 25 Strength, Dexterity and Constitution, 25% Magic Resistance, 50% resistance to all physical damage, and flawless saving throws. He moves extremely fast.~

Icharyd has 50% Fire Resistance, 50% Electricity Resistance, 75% Acid Resistance, and 75% Magic Damage Resistance, in addition to the normal immunity to cold and poison. In battle, Icharyd will first cast Wild Horror and then cast Slay Living. After that, it will attack.~
@24118=~Ike Cascadion Vendar will lead you on a tour of Durlag's Tower, but don't expect him to take you very far in. He also tries to sell adventurers wardstones for the tower, but his wardstones are fake. Don't buy them.~

@24121=~Jardak is immune to all damage. However, he can be made vulnerable by lowering his resistances.~
@24122=~Jebadoh has 60% electricity resistance and at least 36 hit points. Anyone who dares deal damage to him will be smitten by Talos Lightning. Hopefully he will never get into a fight with the other fishers, as that could end very badly...~

@24140=~Silke is a high-level bard. She has a special bard song that deals damage to all enemies within 15 feet equal to 25% of their maximum Hit Points (rounded down). It has no effect on creatures immune to magic damage. In combat, she will sing her bard song in between casting spells while walking toward her enemies.

@28021=~Kale's Strength bonuses to hit and damage are doubled, and the extra bonuses apply to both melee and ranged weapons. He regains 2 hit points whenever he takes damage.~
@28022=~Verr'Sza has permanent Aura Cleansing and is immune to all spells of 3rd-level or below unless he is the source of the spell. He can use all of his Naztharune abilities at will.~
@28023=~Aura can use any item. She creates potions as a very high-level artificer. She can create a wand once per week.~
@28024=~Ishlilka dispels all effects on any creature she hits with a critical hit. She has some great abilities, including Protection from Magical Weapons.~
@28025=~Mur'Neth automatically succeeds on all saving throws. He can turn into a Mustard Jelly and gain most abilities of a Mustard Jelly, including the ability to hit automatically and get a free attack upon being hit by an attack or spell.~
@28026=~Helarine counts as 6 levels higher when using Turn Undead. All magic damage she deals is increased by 50%, and all healing from her spells is increased by 50%.~
@28027=~Whenever White is hit by an attack or spell, he gains the effect of Improved Haste for 1 round. If he goes berserk, he remains controllable but gains all the benefits of the berserk effect. He can give himself a single Stoneskin at will.~
@28028=~Whenever one of Valerie's spells deals damage, it deals an extra die of damage if the target is evil. All creatures have an additional -2 penalty to saves against Valerie's spells.~
@28029=~Isra gets an additional 5% critical hit chance for every 1 Charisma she has over 15. She deals an additional 2d6 magic fire damage with each weapon hit.~
@28030=~Ellyrian can entangle any creature she hits with a melee or ranged attack. All healing or regeneration from her spells and abilities is increased by 100%. She can shapeshift into an ankheg at will.~

@32151=~Snake's Swiftness
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Snake's Swiftness allows a single creature to move and attack extremely fast for a single round. During the round, the creature's movement rate and attacks per round are doubled. In addition, if the target is an animal, a lycanthrope, a yuan-ti, or a character shapeshifted into one such creature, it is sped up further, gaining 2 additional attacks per round and moving at the maximum possible movement rate for the duration.~
@32251=~Beast Sense
(Divination)

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Beast Sense spell allows the druid to see through the eyes of an animal and sense what it senses. For the duration of the spell or until dispelled, the party can see any creature or object that the animal can see. Beast Sense does not by itself allow the druid to control the animal, though it could be cast on a charmed animal for use as a scout. The spell has no effect on a creature that isn't an animal.~
@32252=~Fiery Link
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: All creatures in a narrow line between the caster and an ally
Saving Throw: 1/2

In casting Fiery Link, the caster must choose an allied creature other than <PRO_HIMHER>self. This spell creates a ray of fire linking the caster and that ally, damaging any creatures in between. If the caster and/or the ally move, the fiery link will stretch and contract to fill the distance between them. Every three seconds, any creature that crosses the fiery link (not including the caster or the ally) takes 1d8 fire damage (Save vs. Breath for half). A single caster can cast Fiery Link on multiple allies, but a single ally cannot be targeted by more than one Fiery Link at once.~
@32351=~Call Water Weirds
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Sphere: Summoning, Elemental Water
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily calls water weirds into existence in bodies of water in the current area. These water weirds will fight on the side of whoever cast this spell most recently - if an enemy casts this spell, the water weirds will be hostile, but will switch to the party's side if a party member then casts this spell as well. Unlike other summoning spells, this spell does not summon creatures directly to the caster's side; instead, it spawns water weirds in specific bodies of water in the current area. If the current area does not have any bodies of water large enough for a water weird, the spell does nothing.~
@32352=~Shortening
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Numbers
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Shortening halves the duration of certain effects on the target creature. If the target is an enemy, then all non-harmful effects on the target will have their duration halved unless the target makes a Save vs. Spell at -4. If the target is not an enemy, then all harmful effects on the target will have their duration halved. A "harmful effect" is any effect from a spell or ability that turns a non-hostile creature hostile. The duration is halved from the total duration of the effect, not the remaining duration. An effect can only be shortened once.~
@32451=~Disarm
(Enchantment)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The spell Disarm causes creatures' weapons to disappear. Each enemy in the area of effect must make a Save vs. Wands at -2. On a failure, that creature's weapon vanishes temporarily, and the creature is forced to fight with its fists. For the duration, the creature cannot equip another weapon - if it does so, that weapon vanishes as well. The creature's weapons reappear if it dies before the duration expires. Disarm has no effect if the target is using a natural weapon or does not have a weapon in any of its quickslots.~
@32452=~Forest's Blessing
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 4
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster calls the forest <PRO_HESHE> is currently in for aid in casting spells. For the duration, the caster casts spells as if 10 levels higher. Forest's Blessing has no effect if not cast outside in a forest.~
@32551=~Prolongment
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Numbers
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Prolongment doubles the duration of certain effects on the target creature. If the target is an enemy, then all harmful effects on the target will have their duration doubled unless the target makes a Save vs. Spell at -4. If the target is not an enemy, then all non-harmful effects on the target will have their duration doubled. A "harmful effect" is any effect from a spell or ability that turns a non-hostile creature hostile. The duration is doubled from the total duration of the effect, not the remaining duration. An effect can only be prolonged once.~
@32652=~Drown
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell effectively causes a creature to drown, whether or not that creature is currently underwater. When cast, the target must Save vs. Breath at -2. On a failure, the target's lungs become filled with water, and the target immediately takes nonlethal damage equal to 90% of its maximum hit points, knocking it unconscious if it would be reduced to 1 Hit Point. For 5 rounds, the target also suffers -4 AC, -4 THAC0, -6 Dexterity, and -1 attack per round. Drown has no effect on undead, constructs, elementals, or other creatures that don't breathe.~
@32751=~Power Word, Heal
(Necromancy)
	
Level: 7
Sphere: Healing
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the Power Word of Healing is uttered, one creature of the caster's choice is instantly healed, regaining all Hit Points. The caster can cast Power Word, Heal on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane.~
@32753=~Nonrandom Zone
(Conjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Law
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell drains the randomness out of the current area. For the duration, all creatures automatically hit, never critically miss, deal maximum physical damage with weapons, take minimum damage from spells, succeed on all Saving Throws automatically, and do not trigger wild surges. Nonrandom Zone can only be cast by lawful characters.~

@34151=~Disruptive Surge
(Wild Magic)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

In using this spell, the Wild Mage deliberately employs wild magic to disrupt another creature's spell. The Wild Mage chooses a creature, which should be a spellcaster (arcane or divine). That creature must make a Save vs. Polymorph at -5. If it fails the save, the next spell it casts within 5 rounds will trigger a wild surge. This surge will often cause the spell to fail, though it could have other, unpredictable effects.~
@34152=~Inertia
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell drastically increases the inertia of the target, locking its movement in the direction it is currently moving. The effect of this spell depends on whether or not the target was moving when it was hit by the spell. If it was moving, it will continue hurtling nonstop in that direction against its will for 4 rounds. If it was standing in place, it will be immobilized for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Polymorph at -2 negates the effects of this spell.~
@34153=~Detect Shapeshifters
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Entire area
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets the caster see if any creatures are shapeshifters in disguise. After the spell is cast, all shapeshifters in the current area will glow purple briefly. In addition, the caster will be informed of what kind of shapeshifter each one is. Detect Shapeshifters can detect several different kinds of shapeshifters, including ones that have assumed a different physical form, such as doppelgangers and lycanthropes, as well as ones that appear a different form through illusionary magic, such as rakshasas. The shapeshifters themselves do not automatically realize they have been detected, and the spell does not necessarily cause them to revert to their true form.~

(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature

The creature is able to jump over normally impassable obstacles like fences or walls, as long as they are narrow enough to jump over. At higher levels, the increased jump distance will allow the creature to jump over thicker obstacles.

When the wizard speaks a Power Word of Pulling, <PRO_HESHE> magically pulls another creature to <PRO_HIMHER>self. For one round, the creature will be unable to move of its own will and will be pulled toward the wizard at great speed. During that round, if the wizard moves, the creature will be dragged along with <PRO_HIMHER>. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. The caster can cast Power Word, Pull on a creature even if <PRO_HESHE> cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane.

After 3 seconds, the effect ends; if the creature is in an impassable area at that time, it will instantly jump to the nearest inhabitable space.~

(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The target of this spell will instantly become dangerously drunk, far more than is pleasurable. The target gains four intoxication points for every Constitution point they have less than 25. For example, if the target has 10 Constitution, they will gain 60 intoxication points. Like normal drunkenness, this magical intoxication will wear off over time. A successful Save vs. Spell at -2 negates the effect. Intoxicate has no effect on undead or constructs. Multiple uses of this spell are cumulative.

Note: High levels of intoxication give luck penalties. The size of the penalty depends on the number of intoxication points:

0-49:   No penalty
50-60: -2 Luck
60-69: -4 Luck
70-79: -6 Luck
80-89: -8 Luck
90-99: -10 Luck

The spell affects all allied creatures in the current area, including party members and summoned creatures.~
@34351=~Bounce Spell
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This simple abjuration should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. If the wizard would be hit by a spell within 2 rounds of casting, <PRO_HESHE> will be unaffected, and the incoming spell will be reflected back at its caster. Bounce Spell expires if it reflects a spell, or after 2 rounds have passed. Bounce Spell will not protect the caster from a Dispel Magic. However, it will not be affected by a Dispel Magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This is the necromantic version of the second-level spell Horror. All creatures in the area of effect, friend or foe, must save vs wands at -4 or run away in fear for 1 turn. Unlike the spell Horror, Terror actually physically harms targets' minds. Although this spell affects allies, this does not bother the necromancer, for <PRO_HISHER> allies are undead.~

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to take control of a single slime creature for one turn. Since Control Slime is a particularly specialized spell, it is very effective: the slime gets no Saving Throw, and its Magic Resistance is no help. Control Slime has no effect on non-slimes.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a wall of raging flames. Any creature who attempts to pass through the wall takes 1d4 fire damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 12d4 at level 12.

Saving Throw: Neg.

One of the few offensive illusion spells, Phantasmal Killer causes the target to be struck down by an embodiment of its worst fears.

A Death Ward will prevent the instant death but not the damage. Phantasmal Killer has no effect on undead, constructs, or oozes. It can also be cast by Necromancers.~

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster

The next time the caster backstabs a creature, that spell is released on the creature. The released spell is cast on the creature a number of times equal to the caster's backstab multiplier. If the caster does not have a backstab multiplier, <PRO_HESHE> gains a x2 multipier until the spell is released.~

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0

Saving Throw: None

Redirect Spell changes the target of a spell another creature is casting to a target of one's choice. In using this spell, the caster selects two creatures, one of whom must be casting a spell.

Copy Spell can be used either to double an ally's spell or to turn an enemy's spells against them.~

Any creature that comes within 5 feet of a portal is sucked in and instantly appears at the other portal. That creature won't teleport back unless it leaves and re-enters the area of the portal. Creatures immune to pushing and pulling effects cannot use the portals. Up to five pairs of portals can be active in one area at a time.~
@34458=~Vampiric Link
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Vampiric Link lets the caster absorb any life energy the target loses. For the duration, whenever the target creature takes damage, the caster regains about that many Hit Points. The caster can cast Vampiric Link on allies or enemies, but not on <PRO_HIMHER>self. A single caster can establish Vampiric Links on multiple creatures, but no one creature can be affected by more than one Vampiric Link at once.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Life Transfer allows the caster to exchange <PRO_HISHER> life force with that of another creature, even if that creature is unwilling. If the target fails a Save vs. Polymorph at -4, its current HP is swapped with the caster's current HP. This exchange will not bring the caster above <PRO_HISHER> maximum HP total.~

Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds

This simple but powerful spell should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at <PRO_HIMHER>. It blocks the first spell (of any level) that hits the caster within the next 2 rounds. If a spell is blocked this way, the wizard absorbs its power, regaining a previously cast spell whose level is less than or equal to the level of the spell absorbed. For example, if the wizard is hit by a Finger of Death (7th-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets seven spell levels back-<PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 7th level in power.~

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1

A more functional variant of Mirror Image, the spell Major Mirror Image also gives the caster the ability to control the images directly. When cast, it creates multiple illusory images of the caster, totaling one per caster level. Each image can be controlled independently of the others. Like the images created by Mirror Image, these images will vanish when struck by an attack or a hostile spell, though they have the same Armor Class as the caster.

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

Missile of Patience fires a slow magical projectile at the target, which will deal enormous damage once it hits. Although the missile travels slowly, it pursues the target unstoppably, even going through walls in its path.

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds

This spell turns the caster partially ethereal for a short period of time. While partially ethereal, the caster is immune to non-magical weapons, but is still tangible enough to be able to attack and cast spells. The caster can also move through walls while partially ethereal (unlike the Fly spell, this also works indoors). Simply click on a point to move to, and the caster will float to that point, bypassing normally impassable obstacles in the way.~

Magical projectiles are also frozen immediately after being conjured. All creatures can still move and do actions while time is stopped. Items can still be picked up from the ground, as the effects of this spell end for them when they are grasped by a creature. Once the spell ends, any projectile that had been frozen by the spell will resume flying toward its target.~

Far Sequencer allows the wizard to cast a spell at a target beyond the wizard's visual range. When cast, this spell prompts the wizard to choose a single spell of any level. That spell is immediately released, targeting a creature or point up to 10000 feet away with the spell. The range of the spell will be extended to 10000 feet unless it normally has a range of touch, in which case it should not be used with Far Sequencer.

That spell is then stored inside each ally within 15 feet of the target, including summoned creatures. Each of these creatures will instantly cast their copy of the spell when they die. Note that the spell is treated as cast by the dying creature and at that creature's caster level (1 by default). If Death Trigger were to be cast again, the new spell would replace the previous spell stored in each target.

When selecting a spell, the caster can also choose whether the dying ally will release the spell on itself, on its previous attacker, or on the nearest enemy (there is also a prompt to choose a condition for releasing the spell, but no matter what is chosen, the condition will be on death).~

If an affected creature takes damage, the effects of the spell immediately end for that creature.~
@34854=~Recurring Contingency
(All)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Recurring Contingency is like other Contingency spells, except that the stored spell is cast repeatedly. Upon casting Recurring Contingency, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. During the next hour, the spell will be cast on the target each round that the condition is met (or each time the caster is hit, if the caster chose it to trigger upon getting hit).~
@34855=~Omnipresence
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.~
@34856=~Contingency Curse
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Contingency Curse forces a hostile creature to release spells against its will on the caster's terms. Upon casting Contingency Curse, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. The target of the spell is then cursed to cast that spell repeatedly under those conditions. For example, the caster could store a Web spell and make the creature cast Web on itself whenever it gets hit. Contingency Curse can only curse enemies.~
@34857=~Extend Vision
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Extend Vision allows the recipient to see much farther than <PRO_HESHE> could see before. The recipient will be able to see creatures that are too far away to return the gaze. More importantly, the recipient can target those creatures with spells and ranged attacks from far away. Extend Vision also makes the recipient immune to blindness. It lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled.~
@34858=~~
@34951=~Perfect Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the ultimate form of invisibility. While under the effect of Perfect Invisibility, a creature can attack, cast a spell or otherwise interact with another creature or object while remaining completely invisible. However, Perfect Invisibility can still be dispelled by effects that would dispel regular invisibility, such as True Sight or Dispel Magic. Barring such removal, the spell will last for 3 rounds. Perfect Invisibility can only be cast by Illusionists.~
@34952=~Mass Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 25-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Mass Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of a group of creatures while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victims. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the targets have no option for release, even if made to do something against their morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The targets are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.~
@34953=~Attain Perfection
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily makes the caster perfect in every way. For 1 turn, the caster's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all set to 25. The caster can potentially use this time to equip items with high stat requirements.~
@34954=~Vampiric Feast
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Perhaps the most powerful life-draining spell, Vampiric Feast allows the caster to absorb Hit Points from many victims at once. Every creature in a 15-foot radius takes 30 damage with no Saving Throw. For every creature dealt damage this way, the caster gains 30 temporary hit points. Hit points gained this way are cumulative; the caster can gain a massive amount of health by draining many creatures with Vampiric Feast. The bonus hit points last for six hours.~
@34955=~Mass Sequencer
(Invocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Mass Sequencer allows the caster to cast one of <PRO_HISHER> spells on many creatures simultaneously. When Mass Sequencer is cast, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. Once activated, the sequencer will cast copies of the stored spell on every creature in a 15-foot radius around the target. For example, if the caster stores a Fireball spell and then activates the sequencer on a 15' radius area containing four creatures, then four fireballs will be launched, each targeting a different creature.

At higher levels, the maximum spell level that can be stored in a Mass Sequencer increases:

Caster Level                   Maximum Spell Level
18 and below                   3
19-24                          4
25-30                          5
31-36                          6
37-42                          7
43-48                          8
49 and above                   9~
@34956=~Enoll Eva's Duplication
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This strange, fantastic spell hails from the Planes, where it was the byproduct of esoteric mathematical research by the modron mathemagician Enoll Eva. While Enoll Eva's Duplication is active, the caster's actions are multiplied by 2. The caster attacks twice as many times per round, and whenever <PRO_HESHE> casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately casts that spell an additional time, without using up a spell slot. Note that some spells do not stack and thus will not have double the effect when cast twice.~
@34957=~Executioner's Eyes
(Divination)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Executioner's Eyes enhances the vision of allies, allowing them to see the hidden weaknesses of all creatures.  The spell grants +4 THAC0 and a +20% chance to get critical hits to all allies within the area of effect for the duration of the spell.~

@35374=~Standing before you is a djinni of immense power, the air thick with electricity around it. It regards you coolly. "Greetings to you, spellweaver. Are you ready to begin negotiations?"~
@35375=~The djinni grins widely, winking at you. "Perhaps the wisest of courses, spellweaver. Very well... it shall be as you wish."~
@35376=~The being pauses a moment, surprised, before chuckling with amusement. "We are between moments here, spellcaster. Time has no bearing on you and me while we speak; have no worry."~
@35377=~"The spell you have cast is an attempt to temporarily control vast cosmic power. It is unstable and therefore only truly useful in combat events... unless you have years to devote to the formulation of your wish, of course."~
@35378=~"It is that formulation that requires negotiation." The djinni pulls a quill and a paper scroll from the air, grinning. "Since you do not have years to waste, you will attempt to describe to me what you desire from your wish."~
@35379=~"And I," here the djinni looks pleased, "will use my vast intelligence to distort your purpose as I please. Don't feel bad... the forces at work here are such that it is not often that one gets what one truly hopes for."~
@35380=~"But you can certainly try. The wise often do well... and you spellweavers are often quite wise, yes?" It taps its quill thoughtfully on its head. "Do you wish to begin, then?"~
@35381=~The djinni nods. "As you say." Quickly, the two of you begin negotiating a complex contract. The djinni is tricky, carefully attempting to twist your meaning with words, legal phrases, and clauses that you can barely understand...~
@35382=~Fortunately, you are quick to catch on. Before long, you begin tricking the djinni's phrasings yourself, leaving it quite frustrated. You still doubt you'll get what you want, but chances are the djinni won't be able to trick you.~
@35383=~You are wise enough to keep pace with the djinni, preventing the being from taking total advantage of you. Still... the contract is hard to understand, and you wonder at the end result.~
@35384=~Throughout the process, the djinni continues to baffle you... and you are not even sure if your desired wish will be similar to your original premise. At best, you stall the worst of the clauses.~
@35385=~Your lack of wisdom leaves you at a complete disadvantage. Throughout the writing of the contract, the djinni all but bullies you mentally into a position of watching him all but write the complex document on his own... there are few objections you can make.~
@35386=~The contract complete, the djinni dons a pair of spectacles and looks it over with an arched brow. "Very well, spellcaster. I can interpret the items listed here in the following ways. Choose carefully which you would prefer."~
@35387=~I am ready.~
@35388=~Negotiations? What do you mean?~
@35389=~I don't have time to negotiate in the middle of combat!~
@35390=~No, I have changed my mind. Return to whence you came.~
@35391=~Then explain to me what you meant by negotiations.~
@35392=~Then let us begin.~
@35393=~Never mind. Return to where you came from, djinni.~
@35394=~But we don't have time to do all this in the middle of combat!~

(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 2-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th-in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 2-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster-for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~

(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 10d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. The targets are also knocked back, whether they make the save or not.~
@44432=~Vitriolic Sphere
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~

The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 1d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Anyone hit by the victim's flames will contract the shroud themselves. The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area.~

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell surrounds the caster with an invisible barrier that moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. This barrier makes the wizard immune to any magical attacks, but it prevents <PRO_HIMHER> from casting spells.

@44626=~Lich Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> hands glow with an unearthly blue radiance. When the wizard attacks a creature with the lich's touch, that creature takes 1d2 fist damage (plus Strength bonus) and 3d10 magic cold damage, and the creature must Save vs. Paralysis at -2 or be paralyzed for 3 rounds. Undead and constructs only take the fist damage and are not paralyzed. The lich's touch can affect creatures that require +6 weapons in order to hit.~

@44724=~Acid Storm
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1d4 points of acid damage each round for the first three rounds, 1d6 points for the next three rounds, and 1d8 points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage-the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud-if successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).~
@44726=~Suffocate

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7

A successful Save vs. Breath at -4 negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it can take a round for a character to catch their second wind.~

Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting <PRO_HIMHER> several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to fire and poison, and 25% resistant to all physical damage. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster, such as Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Flaying, or Drown, are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal.~
