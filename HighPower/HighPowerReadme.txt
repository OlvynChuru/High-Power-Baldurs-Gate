This readme describes the optional components of the mod. Excluding the main component, they are as follows:


- Make the Friends spell set Charisma to 20 rather than increase it

In this mod, I wanted 25 Charisma to be something you'd work hard to get (through stat-increasing tomes). By the end of the game, one of your characters might have 25 Charisma through the use of these tomes. I think that being able to get 24 Charisma right at the start of the game with little effort is anticlimactic.


- Adjust charisma-based store discounts

This component decreases the store discounts for medium Charisma scores but lets the discount keep getting larger past 20 Charisma. Since characters can now get 25 Charisma through means other than Friends, I wanted to give them something for it. The discounts are as follows:
Charisma	Discount
11		1%
12		2%
13		3%
14		4%
15		5%
16		7%
17		9%
18		11%
19		13%
20		15%
21		17%
22		19%
23		21%
24		23%
25		25%

(for comparison, in the unmodded game 25% is the largest discount possible, which you get if you have at least 20 Charisma)


- Give all classes four weapon slots

The extra weapon slots can only be accessed through the inventory screen, but you can still equip weapons in them.


- Remove helmet animations

This component lets you make all helmets invisible, with the exception of nonmagical decorative helmets if you so choose. If you choose to have decorative helmets be visible, there is also a special visible version of the basic horned helmet, which is carried by Ajantis and dropped by most hobgoblins.


- Increase chance to learn spells

I don't know if this component will be everyone's thing, but it's something I prefer personally. I hate the mechanic of failing to learn a spell, because it ruins the satisfaction of obtaining a cool new scroll. The component has two options: either it sets the chance to learn a spell to 99% for all Intelligence scores with which the chance is normally less than 99%, or it sets the chance to 150% for all Intelligence scores >= 9.


- Let non-warrior Constitution HP bonuses continue past 16 Constitution

This component lets non-warriors get HP bonuses at 17, 18, 19, 21, and 24 Constitution, just like warriors. This way, there are more benefits of having high Constitution.


- Modify shorty save bonuses

Normally, the saving throw bonuses halflings, gnomes and dwarves get based on their base Constitution cap at 18 Con. However, since it's possible to get up to 25 base Constitution in this mod, having it cap at 18 is silly. This component decreases the save bonuses shorties get at 18 Constitution (from +5 to +4), but it increases the save bonuses they get at 25 Constitution (from +5 to +6).


- Remove the limit of two proficiency points in a weapon at character creation

Excluding new kits or changes to existing kits by other mods, this only affects the Fighter class and the Archer kit. My reasoning for this is that the main advantage of fighters in Baldur's Gate is the ability to get more than two proficiency points in a weapon. However, since a fighter can only put in two points in a weapon at character creation, they are initially no better at fighting than any other warrior (while those other warriors have cool abilities). This will allow a fighter to be noticably better at wielding a weapon than, say, a paladin, right from the start of the game.


- Increase the rate at which warriors and bards get proficiency points

Since this mod introduces so many interesting weapons to the game, you may want to use a weapon no one in the party has any proficiency in. But with only one extra proficiency point per 3 levels, warriors don't become much more versatile within BG1 alone. This component lets fighters get an additional proficiency point every level, while rangers, paladins and bards get an additional point every 2 levels.


- Give proficiency-based extra attacks per round to non-warriors

This only matters if those non-warriors can get more than one proficiency point in a weapon. I thought it would be nice for swashbucklers to get another 1/2 attack per round, since they don't get as many bonuses in BG1 as they do in ToB.


- Make Assassin backstab multiplier increase faster

One of the main features of assassins is the fact that their backstab multiplier keeps increasing after 5x. However, since they don't get to 6x or 7x until BG2, this feature is completely meaningless in BG1. This component allows assassins to become noticably better at backstabbing than a normal thief even in BG1. It makes it so that assassins get a multiplier bonus every three levels after 1, rather than than every four levels after 1.


- Improve Wizard Slayers

This component does two things: it changes the progressive Magic Resistance gain to +5% per level (so it becomes noticable even in BG1) and makes the on-hit spell failure effect offer a Save vs. Breath at -10.


- Improve Dragon Disciples

This component lets a Dragon Disciple gain additional uses of the breath weapon at levels 6 and 9. I don't like how they normally only get one use of it.


- Improve Monks

Monks aren't great in BG1 normally. Sure, they make up for it by being awesome in BG2, but I don't care about BG2 in this mod. This component mainly gives monks more potential at high level. It changes the monk XP table so that a monk can reach level 9 in BG1, and it gives each monk kit a great ability at level 9. Unkitted Monks get Quivering Palm, Sun Soul Monks get Sun Soulbeam, and Dark Moon Monks get Darkness 15' Radius (it's a different file from the one in Siege of Dragonspear). Dark Moon Monks also now have a x2 backstab multiplier (which doesn't improve) and get Mirror Image at level 8 instead of level 11.


- Allow Kensai to wear gloves

The main advantage of a Kensai is their bonus to hit and damage. However, the fact that they can't wear gauntlets means that their THAC0 and damage are barely any better than a regular Fighter, who can wear the Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise and get almost the same bonuses. This component allows a Kensai to wear gauntlets. You may also choose to allow them to wear bracers as well (the argument against this is that it would defeat the purpose of their drawback of not being able to wear armor).


- Put a Bag of Holding in the game

This component makes a Bag of Holding obtainable in non-SOD Baldur's Gate 1. The component lets you choose whether to make it easily accessible right at the beginning of the game or to delay it until you can get to Baldur's Gate. It also lets you choose whether the bag can hold a medium number of items or a virtually unlimited number.


- Raise the experience cap (only recommended for solo players)

This component lets you set the experience cap for BG1 to whatever you want. Note that although increasing the experience cap won't necessarily make the mod too easy, the mod was heavily designed around the 161000 cap. This component is primarily intended for solo players who would otherwise reach the experience cap too fast.


- Have all player-created characters start with some experience at the beginning of the game

If you want to start the game at a higher level, this component lets you give starting experience to all player-created characters. You get to enter the amount of experience to give, though it cannot take the character past the XP cap. This component will NOT give experience to joinable NPCs (though as usual they will start at a higher level if the protagonist is high level).

Note: With regards to the balance of this component, the early parts of the mod are designed in a way as to be beatable by a low level party but still challenging for a high level party. Even still, starting at max level will definitely make the Nashkel Mines a lot easier. If you want to start at a higher level without changing the difficulty of the early game much, I recommend choosing to start with 2500, 5000, or 10000 experience. Since the party reaches the XP cap quickly in this mod even if they start with 0 experience, starting with slightly more experience won't matter much in the long run.


- Move Quayle to be accessible near the beginning of the game

This component moves Quayle to the obelisk between the Friendly Arm Inn and Beregost.


- Move Eldoth to be accessible near the beginning of the game

This component moves Eldoth to Red Sheaf Inn. It changes his dialogue a little bit so he doesn't say he's in a forest.


- Move Tiax to be accessible near the beginning of the game

This component moves Tiax to the area north of Nashkel, along the road.


- Allow bard songs to stack

Before the Enhanced Editions prevented bards songs from stacking, I had done multi-bard playthroughs. From my experience, stacking bard songs was powerful but not broken. This component allows songs from multiple bards of the same kit to stack.


- Revise Wisdom bonus spell table

Normally, as your Wisdom goes up you eventually stop receiving bonus spells for lower spell levels. This isn't a problem in the base game since your Wisdom score can only be so high. However, in this mod you can potentially increase your Wisdom up to 25 using tomes, so I wanted to give you a reward for doing so. This component makes it so that you will keep getting bonus divine spells as your Wisdom score reaches epic heights. It overwrites the normal Wisdom bonus spell table.


- Allow Arkanis, Deder, Osprey, Mordaine, and Canderous to be taken outside of Candlekeep

Normally these five NPCs leave your party after you end the combat tutorial. Installing this component lets them stay in your party, so you can take them through the rest of the game.
