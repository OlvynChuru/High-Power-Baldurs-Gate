- Many mod NPCs will gain their own unique powers.
- PCs will get their starting powers even if they joined the party after Candlekeep (e.g. if you created a PC in the middle of a multiplayer game). In addition, mod NPCs who haven't been assigned unique abilities will get the starting powers for their kit (or the starting powers for their base class if they have a custom kit) rather than getting nothing.

- I split the component that moves Eldoth, Quayle and Tiax to early-game locations into 3 components, one for each character.

v1.6.1:

- Rilsa's Leathers no longer has the wrong icon, and I fixed a bug that stopped some of the effects of the armor from working.
- I fixed glitches in a couple of item descriptions that caused dash characters to be replaced with rectangles. I don't think I've gotten rid of all the rectangles, though.
- Most hobgoblins now wear HELM11 rather than HELM01. This means that if you have the subcomponent "Make all helmets invisible, except for nonmagical decorative helmets" installed, the hobgoblin helmets will still be visible. HELM11 looks identical to HELM01, but it's a different file.
- Hobgoblin Elites no longer have longer casting times.

- I put a dragon somewhere in the game. He doesn't drop scales but he has a large hoard.
- I replaced the Know Alignment spell with Identify Creature, which displays a different string depending on the creature it is cast upon. However, so far I have only given a string to about 10% of the creatures I am modifying. I still have much more work to do.


v1.5:
- The mod now includes an English TRA file. All strings in the TP2 file have been replaced with TRA references.
- Some, but not all, of the new magic items that previously only had placeholder descriptions now have actual descriptions.

- 1 more component has been added; it lets you choose whether to change the starting positions of Quayle,
 Eldoth and Tiax, so that they can join your party earlier on.

- Planetars are no longer immune to +2 weapons.


v1.2:
- 18 extra components have been added; some of them change spells, some change 2da files, others change classes or kits.
- A readme has been added; it explains what the components do.
- The Seeking Sword now dispels Mirror Image and Invisibility effects on hit; I gave it a description, and I updated the description of the Seeking Sword ability, and the description of it in the Priest of Helm description.
- Archer player characters now get Breach at the beginning of the game as they're supposed to.

v1.1:
- Gorion can no longer kill the protagonist in the fight with Sarevok.
